 Bob, 
 
 Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
 only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
 transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
 2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
 made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
 Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
 combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
 is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
 as my nominations are primary FT.
 
 Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.
 
 Thank you.  
 
 Steve Phillips
