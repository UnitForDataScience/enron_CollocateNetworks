
 
 Thanks Cynthia.  
 
 Could you please try the W (since I know that one) and let me know as soon as 
 possible?  Greatly appreciated.  
 
 And I'll go ahead on the frequent flyer miles.  I'm assuming that the ticket 
 you booked for me (is the one that leaves SF on 8/2 at 9:15 AM and returns 
 from NYC on 8/5 at 4:15 EDT)?
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
