 Sorry I missed you last night.  I was running about half an hour late, then
 arrived only to circle around for another 30 minutes looking for parking.
 Unfortunately, I had accidentally left your phone number on a slip of paper
 at work.
 
 In any event, sorry again to miss your visit.  Hope to see you the next time
 you swing through town,
 
 Randy
