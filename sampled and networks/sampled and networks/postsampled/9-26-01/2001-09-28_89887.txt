 I'll keep you posted.

 Miller has indicated to us this afternoon (informally) that our bid was not one of the top two they are considering.  Both Jeff and I are continuing to follow-up with Miller to see if there is anything we can do, but it appears our pricing fell short (we quoted $38.80/MWh, which was $1/MWh below the desk offer of $39.80).  Please call if you would like to discuss.
 
 Thanks
