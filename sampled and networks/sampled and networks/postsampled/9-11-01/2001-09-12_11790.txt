         In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned a=
 bout the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYM=
 EX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.
 
         For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worrie=
 d that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might foll=
 ow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprar=
 dy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX cle=
 aring falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NY=
 MEX payment performance?????
