 GDP-St.CLAIR		Omicron 14
 GDP-NGPL(IA-IL	Omicron 11
 GDP-MONCHY		Omicron 11
 
 Can you let me know when this is done so that I can get Souad's VaR rerun.  Thanks for your help.  You also need to let me know if you guys can go to lunch on me on Friday.

 Hey Phillip,
 These are the unmapped curves.  Please let me know what OMICRONS they should be mapped to and I'll have Nilay do it.  This is your problem.  Large hedge benefits are not being captured in her books.
