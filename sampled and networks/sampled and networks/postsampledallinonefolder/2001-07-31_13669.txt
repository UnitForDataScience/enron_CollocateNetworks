 Great news about the tix.  We easily can have Cam sit on our laps, so no need to get any great seats

          Got your message on the voicemail at home but haven't been home in
       the
          evening to call you back, and won't be home this evening either!
       I've
          been
          so busy at work since we got back from vacation.  We had a great
    time
       I
          love
          Scandinavia, can't wait to go back.
 
          Hannah and Erik and the two boys are great, the kids are cute - so
       very
          blonde, but Hannah is thinking of having a third....and if she
    does
       her
          doctor has said she will be in a wheelchair for half the pregnancy
    -
       she
          has
          that pelvic thing, she was on crutches with Frankie.  Sounds like
    a
       bid
          idea
          to me, but she is a stubborn little one.
 
          So what's up?  Still coming out to see us I hope?  Everything else
       going
          well?
