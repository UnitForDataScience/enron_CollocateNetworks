 I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology.  Scott Neal and Tom Martin would like to attend as well.  This afternoon at 2 PM or later would work for us.  Please let me know what time we could meet.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Phillip
 
  
     
 Renee,
 
 Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Phillip Allen
