
 
 I've checked with Alan and I think Mike R. is probably the right guy all the way around.

 Please find attached first drafts of:
 
 1 the Master Agreement;
 2 the Forward Sale Agreement; and
 3 the Agency Agreement.
 
  <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>>  <<010702_Forward_Sale_Agreemnt_DES.doc>>  
 <<010702_DES_EnronAgencyAgreement.doc>> 
 
 
 For ease of review, I also attach:
 
 1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
 Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);
 
  <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>> 
 
 2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical
 metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); and
 
  <<REVISED3.DOC>> 
 
 3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
 Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);
 
  <<PhysMstrvAgency.doc>> 
 
 
 Please note the following:
 
 1. General
 
 - I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in
 the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to
 ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements
 of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of
 Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate
 side letter. 
 - To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this
 transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master
 Agreement.
 - These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject
 to their comments.
 
 2. Master Agreement
 
 - As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the
 concepts of "Reference Price" and "Pricing Date", which are similar to those
 contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions.
 - Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call
 Options on non-Business Days.
 - I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the
 Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that
 does remain in the Master Agreement is that of "Agency Costs", which is, in
 some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be
 discussed.
 - I have removed the concept of "Minimum Value", which I understand will not
 form part of this transaction.
 - I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an
 imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences
 of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this
 (see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5).
 
 3. Forward Sale Agreement
 
 - I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the
 Agency and the Master Agreements.
 - The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed.
 - I have removed "Credit Support Default" as an Event of Default.
 
 4. Agency Agreement
 
 - As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make
 this agreement as distinct as possible.
 
 
 I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this
 transaction.
 
 Kind regards
 Deepak
