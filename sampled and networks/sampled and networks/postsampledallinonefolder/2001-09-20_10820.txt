 	of Raetta if Jean is gone?  Does Jean need to have more specific instructions to cover Transok that
 	specifies the timing for putting the allocations in the system?  Thanks. Lynn

 	Debra, I understand you were covering for Jean Adams while she was on vacation.
 	Did we have the proper coverage to get CMS allocated volumes in GVA reviewed
 	as we needed.  Just wanted to follow up.  I would be glad to visit with you about
 	this if we need.
 
 	Thanks. Lynn
