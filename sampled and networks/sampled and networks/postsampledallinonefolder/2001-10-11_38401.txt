 I remember him as being a passive guy.  He is very conservative, level headed, and fairly organized.  I would test his ability to handle new businesses and stress.
 
 By the way, he worked at Coastal when I was there.

 Don,
 
 I forwarding the resume of David Horacefield.  I was wondering if you were interested in talking to this candidate as a potential replacement for Roger Reynolds.  He has good Texas Natural Gas knowledge.
 
 Let me know.
 
 Regards,
 Todd Peikert
