 	we can do a conference call to explain the cuts?  Just a suggestion.  Thanks. Lynn

 Kay,
 
 Bill Anderson from US Energy mentioned to Kent and I at the KC Operations meeting that his FDD injection overrun volumes are being cut completely when there is a storage allocation.  At first, I thought this was due to a discounted injection overrun rate being charged to LS Power/Cogentrix.  However, you confirmed yesterday that LS Power/Cogentrix is paying the full injection overrun rate, and therefore should get a pro-rata piece of the available capacity at the time of the allocation.  
 
 I told Bill that we would look into our allocation process, and find out why LS Power/Cogentrix was being cut completely.  Could you let me know if you find anything incorrect in our allocation process with regards to the LS Power/Cogentrix account?  Perhaps LS Power/Cogentrix is entered into the allocation system incorrectly as a discounted rate?  
 
 Please let me know what you find.  I would like to respond to Bill as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks!!
