 Michelle,
 
 Discussed the latest draft separation agreement with Joe today.  He has just a couple more questions.
 
 1.	Article 7.9 was adjusted to add the first sentence, which references articles of the employment agreement.  He wants to know the intent of this addition.  Also, article 4.4 is referenced and there is no 4.4 in the employment agreement.
 
 2.	Article 7.10 - He is still concerned about the situation where Enron is acquired by a company where he was employed.  I explained to him that such a situation would not fall under "rehire" by Enron.  However, he would like the last sentence to read, "This provision would not apply if Employee is employed by an entity that may be acquired by or acquires a Company after the effective date of this agreement."
 
 These are all the items for you.  I'm still haggling with him over home leave and timing on shipment of goods.  Let me know your thoughts on the above and I think I can get him to agree to some terms that we can finalize.
 
 Regards,
