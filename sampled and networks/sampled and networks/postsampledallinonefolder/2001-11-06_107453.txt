 We have confirmation that the prior fax (in its entirety) went through.  
 Call if you have a problem.

 Sibyl:
 
 Did you want me to dupe the Enron Corp. documents, i.e., change
 signature lines?
 I have a copy of the Corporate Account Agreement (including the
 Schedule) but not the Repo.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
