 	and I can borrow theirs.  Thanks. Lynn
 
   it is for the use of ETS' employees.  (NOTE:  The posting for the EDM standards book shows a date of November 15, 1999.  This is only a typo on the Web page.  The actual book is dated June 18, 2001.)
 
 Paper copies of the version 1.5 standards will be available.  Early next week Alma Carrillo will distribute a form for requesting paper copies.  We will coordinate this effort for the Houston people.  I'll let you know the coordinator for Omaha.  You can also print the standards directly from the GISB Web site.  
 
 Please let me know if you need help obtaining the standards books or have further questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Theresa
