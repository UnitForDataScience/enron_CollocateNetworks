 David Tagliarino, Enron Sports Marketing Group, received a call today from John Yee, CFO of the SF Giants.  David, John and I got back on the phone this morning.  Following is a summary of our discussion:
 
 John Yee, CFO, SF Giants, received a letter from the CA AG's office requesting their cooperation in an "....investigation concerning Enron....".  (John will fax that letter to me and I will circulate it)
 John called the AG's office per their request in the letter received
 The AG's office was digging for a bunch of information:
 total MWH consumed
 contract start date
 term of contract
 general questions about T's & C's
 whether Enron had cancelled the contract
 who was supplying electricity
 copies of the agreements and letters of communication from Enron to the SF Giants
 John was generally responsive and indicated that Enron has been great, has honored its contract, still has a contract in place, etc.
 John pushed back on supplying any more information without a written request from the AG's office, and then also indicated that they would only supply what was required by law
 The AG's office responded by indicating that they may have to subpoena the Giants
 John will wait and see what the AG's office does
 He will keep us in the communication loop and make sure that we have copies of the communication from the AG's office
 
 Thanks - Dan
