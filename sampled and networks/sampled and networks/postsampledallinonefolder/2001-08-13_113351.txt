 Can you coordinate with Jay Dudley at 503-464-8860 on how to change the filing (if at all) on PGE's pipeline issue?  PGE is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on Native Load.  They are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity (about 170,000 mmcf/d) rather than assume its right.
 
 The goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next Friday, Aug 17. 
 
 Please call me with any questions. 
 
 Thanks,
