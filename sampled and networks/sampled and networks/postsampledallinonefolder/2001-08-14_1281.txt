 Andy Lewis, a director on the Central Desk, has agreed to participate as a content SME.  I plan on being heavily involved in reviewing the content as well.

 Kirk, here are two documents I have revised, assuming a start date for the
 week of August 24 for actual content work/design, not just kick off.  This
 slips our delivery into the new year.  Please review and let's talk about
 them the next time we meet.  I hope your meetings are going well.
 
 
 List of deliverables and tentative and aggressive due dates, all to be
 revised once we start.  In addition, as we move through design, many of
 these deliverables will become unit based to ease our tracking of progress,
 but since we don't know how many topics/expert stories... that we are
 building, it is difficult to create that tracking now.

 Here is the revised list I mentioned as our SME goals each week, assuming a
 start as stated above.
 (See attached file: SME Meeting Schedule 081301.doc)
 
 I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Give me a call and let me
 know how things are going.
