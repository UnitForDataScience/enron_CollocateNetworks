 Heather - If I don't get the PRB coal curves by the end of this week, I will have to remove access to our power curves.
 
  
     
 Matt,
 
 Do you have a Coal Curve for Today?  Also, do you know the Curve Code for the curve that you send me.  They need that in order to automate this process, so that you don't have to e-mail me any more.
 
 Thanks
 
 Jason
