         Scott:
 
         I have updated the attached matrix that: 1) reflects  legislative
 
 developments I read about in today and  Friday's trade mags; 2)
 
 highlights the bills that seem of  particular importance to Enron.
 
         Please review and let me know your input.  Again, the goal is  to
 
 identify the key bills and review them  regularly during the Tuesday and
 
 Thursday CA calls.
 
         Also, are you aware of whether we have analyzed the  implications
 
 of and differences between the two  windfall profits tax bills (ABX 2 2 -
 
 Corbett and SBX2 1)?    Our retail folks are very
 
 interested in the tax issue, and I have  been asked to provide them with
 
 updates and information.
 
         Thanks,
 
         Jennifer
