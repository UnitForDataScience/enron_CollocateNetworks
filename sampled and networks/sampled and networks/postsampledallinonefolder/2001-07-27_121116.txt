 I did leave you a voice message.  The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.  Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
  

    
 
 Janette,
 
 Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in
 order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the
 guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable
 to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP
 BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.
 
 Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day
 but have moved back up.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
