   on our own computers and in our offices. (Operating from your office may be an inconvenience, but it minimizes the risk of losing control of sensitive documents that have no bearing on the case. -gc)
 
 	(4) We can review at the pace dictated by the litigation, which is
 unpredictable (to say the least).  (As long as access to your office spaces and the system is made available this should not be an issue. -gc)
 
 Concerns about security and confidentiality are common in all litigation and
 document review.  We always take these concerns seriously.  We will restrict
 access to these documents to only those persons involved with reviewing and
 organizing the documents.  We will work with you to ensure that these
 documents will remain in strict confidence.
 
 Again, I truly appreciate your taking the time to discuss these matters with
 me as well as with Dave and Richard.  If there is any further information
 you need, please do not hesitate to ask.  
 
 Very truly yours, 
 
 Peter Meringolo
