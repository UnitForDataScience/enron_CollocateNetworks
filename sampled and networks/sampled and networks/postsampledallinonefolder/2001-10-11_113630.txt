 While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge=
 nerators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATIO=
 N ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper=
  states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE=
 S TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN

 Jim,
 
 Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by =
 the CBO entitled, "Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis".  In re=
 viewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly=
  accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ign=
 ore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were s=
 upposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate term=
 s, such as "Idle" when describing plants that were unavailable because of m=
 aintenance or repair.
 
 My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper=
  like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on =
 problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in=
  CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do=
  we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some =
 of the claims made in this paper?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
