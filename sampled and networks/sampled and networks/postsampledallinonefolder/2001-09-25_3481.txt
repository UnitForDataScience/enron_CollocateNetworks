 Yesterday was just a little crazy.  Crude had it's biggest fall in 10 years so that translated into a very busy day.  Plus my best employee was just offered a job across the street for a big chunk of money.  At least I made money. 
 I should be getting my phone line at home today (of course they've been saying that for 5 days now) at which point they can install dsl.  Thatll make it much easier.  
 Went to the bb game again last night.  Love them stros.  
 How'd you're presentation go last night? Did the doc talk good about your drug?
 Have a good one,
 Jonh
