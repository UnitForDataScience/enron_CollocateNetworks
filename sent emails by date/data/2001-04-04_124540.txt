 I had a great time. The weather was macnificent. And I have a great tan.
 My
 brothers wedding went smoothley.
 But its great news that you will be spending more time in London. How
 much
 time exactley? It would be a marvellous scope if you could pull off a
 transfer to London as well. I am currently at the moment feeling a bit
 sick
 because last night I ate some dodgy food.
 
 Jo and Nichole have settled in to London life. They are both cool. They
 have both found jobs so its all going smooth.
 We will all be going out this weekend for my birthday.
 
 Love
