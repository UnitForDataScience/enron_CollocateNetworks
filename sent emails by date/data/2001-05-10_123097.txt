 I noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so I am forwarding them to you to catch you up.  I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.  He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Charlie Weldon

 Matt-
 
 I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.
 
 I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.
 
 ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.
 
 Ray
