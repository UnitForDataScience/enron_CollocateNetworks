 Errol - Can you please provide me your access information ASAP (requested 
 below on March 13).  If your team will not need access to the Trader Report 
 Viewer web-site please let me know.  Thank you!  Shirley

 Team -
 Please provide me your list of names for each trader that should have "View 
 Access" for your region on the Trader web-site to be developed.  If you also 
 need "Update Access, in addition to view access" please provide a separate 
 list for those as well. 
 
 Please send me your lists by end of day tomorrow (Wed, 3/14) if possible, or 
 let me know when you can provide the information.  Thank you for your help!!
 Shirley
