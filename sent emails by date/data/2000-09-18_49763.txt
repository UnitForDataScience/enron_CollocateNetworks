 I had to cancel my trip to London. Steve Leppard will

 Colleagues,
 
 Greetings.
 
 I'd like to plan a dinner subsequent to the adjournment of this week's EPRM
 Conference in London Fri. 9/22.  Whereas some of you have already notified
 me of your availability or travel plans, please advise whether you are
 available for dinner on Fri. 9/22 or Sat. 9/23.
 
 Ehud
