
 
  Capital Support Agreement:  Orion Power Company (a 
 subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity 
 support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot 
 be met.  We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these 
 obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or 
 Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.
 
 The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this 
 credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:
 the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 2002
 the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM 
 of debt reamains outstanding)
 pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15x
 
 Given there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC 
 does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.  To the 
 extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for 
 these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.
 
 Regards,
