 I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember 
 seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if 
 payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created 
 clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does 
 Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave 
 many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws, 
 though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.
 
 If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday 
 at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21. Very 
 disruptive of my self-perception.
 
 Ciao,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 
 
 


  
  
 
 Hello Kayit asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge receipt
 of the notice.  It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge
 receipt.  What do you think or remember?  Am I required to sign the notice
 or not.  Minor point I know, but I'd rather not raise the flag in
 Birmingham.
 
 Thanks.  I really just want to hear from you and this is all I could come up
 with for an excuse to write.
