 Thanks for the note.  Mansoor and I have talked and we would definitely like you to put a hold on this meter.  I will keep you posted on Questar's response to the list of equipment that you provided us last week as to how quickly they could receive any of this equipemnt.
 
 Thanks, Kim.

 Instromat will have a 10" ultra sonic meter and calibrations ready by the end of March. I have not seen the approved PA. If this is a go, I can put a hold on this meter for Delivery to the Questar facility. Please let me know if Marketing would like to proceed on this. 
 
 Thanks
