 Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate 
 way to run the report is showing only term deals. The "Schedule" and 
 "Liquidate" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and 
 therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, 
 which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let 
 me know what you think.
 
 Thanks,

 Good afternoon, IT Wizards -
 
 I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
 possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
 the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
 desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
 to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
 difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
 Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
 chance.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate Symes
