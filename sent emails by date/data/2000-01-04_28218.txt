 Marathon and Phillips Join Protest
 
     Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their
 joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess
 capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have
 joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The
 protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity
 assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks
 ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case
 settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell
 part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than
 PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to
 protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at
 other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point,
 the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis
 differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large.
 Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis
 differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the
 excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California.

 
 Calpine Buys Reserves from Vintage
 
      Calpine has acquired 90 Bcf of natural gas reserves from Vintage
 Petroleum for $71.5 million, becoming the largest gas producer in
 California?s Sacramento Valley. Calpine bought the remaining 58% interest in
 the Rio Vista field that it did not already own, along with some exploration
 rights. It received the 42%  stake when it acquired Sheridan Energy last
 November for $128 million. Calpine plans to purchasing natural gas fields and
 pipelines so it can provide fuel for its natural gas powered generators at
 lower costs. Calpine plans to expand its electric generation businesses in
 California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada along with the Southeast and Northeast.
 It operates power plants that can generate 3,400 MW.

 Callon Natural Gas Blowout
 
     Callon Petroleum had a natural gas blowout while drilling a test well in
 the Gulf of Mexico and a fire is burning from a portion of the well. There
 were no injuries at the  at South Marsh Island Block 261 well, about 60 miles

 casing about 20 feet above sea level. Wild Well Control, a well-blowout
 specialty company, is making preparations to bring the well under control.
