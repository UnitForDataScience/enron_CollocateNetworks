  SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring al=
 l such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral =
 damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror fo=
 rever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence th=
 e following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours=
  after the preceeding sanction):
 1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
 2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
 3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
 4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
 5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificat=
 es will be issued for humanitarian reasons)
 
 If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove=
  all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Ja=
 va.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SA=
 DIST. =20
 
  
  
 
 Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls thi=
 s morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.
 Donna Scott is working with the mail room.=20
 
 Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this =
 A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyo=
 ne knows anything, would you please let me know!
