 We can use the Deemed ISDA format I already sent you.  And the guarantees 
 (when we get them) should work for allfinancial transactions.

 Tana,
 
 Another deal was executed on 8/25/00 with  Gas Natural Mexico (#NW9602).  Can 
 we have this deal roll up under the pending Deemed ISDA and Gty that their 
 parent was to issue ENA (Use Credit Previously Provided)?
 
 Give me a call at x6-6002 if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Veronica
 
 
 
 
 Pleae forward Legal a contact name, address and phone/fax number for the 
 counteparts so that they can include in the documents.
 
  
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Veronica Espinoza
