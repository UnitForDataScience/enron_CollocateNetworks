 is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is 
 a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can 
 probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that 
 would be ok.

 Attached at the request of IDB is a draft ISDA Master Agreement Schedule for
 the Monterrey project Hedging Agreements.  A preliminary draft of this
 document has been circulated and discussed between IDB and SG, but this
 draft is being circulated concurrently to all parties and has not yet been
 finally between the Banks.
