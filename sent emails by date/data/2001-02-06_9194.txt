 Richard are coming as well.  You might tell Mike that we can provide the two 
 of them with desk space as well, but that we will reserve the spot with the 
 computer and phone for Mike.  And schedule some time for me to meet with him 
 on Thursday as well.  I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way.  
 
 You might e:mail Mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with 
 computer, network connection and phone on 33.  You might also offer to set up 
 any appointments for him while is here.  Thanks. 
 Sally
