 Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues.  He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.
 
 Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to.  The total cost of his trip was $1603.28
 
 Many thanks.
