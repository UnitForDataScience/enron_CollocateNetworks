 7,800 Redelivered at FCV
 
 We will be testing the compressor station tomorrow morning.  Please be advised
 if the
 compressor cannot flow at a sustained volume it will be shut down and the
 remainder
 of the gas delivered at Busby will be considered an "incremental sale."  If 
 you
 have
 any questions please call me at (713) 627-6202.
 
 Thanks,
 Chad Cass
