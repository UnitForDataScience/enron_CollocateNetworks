 	in the chain of command I should visit with on this issue.  Let's see what
 	kind of a response I get.  If that does not work, then Mike or Shelley
 	may need to call.  I will let you know.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 I never heard anything from Oneok on pulling a sample at Mt. Jesus, no one from Oneok or from a consulting firm ever called.  Have you heard anything?
