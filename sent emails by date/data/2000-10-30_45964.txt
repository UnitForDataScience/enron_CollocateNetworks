 the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn 
 around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it.

 Tana,
 
 Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest
 versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the only
 outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for EnronCredit.com
 Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the
 outcome of this last credit point that you refer to.
 
 My fax number is 0207 330 9999.
 
 Many thanks for your assistance.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Clare
