 John,
 
 
 This is our estimate of the support staff requirements for the NGL business.
 
 Risk Book:	1 full time
 Logistics:	1 full time
 
 Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs
 
 Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.
