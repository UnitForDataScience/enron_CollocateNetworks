 Just in from watering the west 40.  I think this is going to be our best
 year ever - lookin' good, lookin' good.  However, there is some serious
 weeding that someone needs to do!!!
 
 I am presuming you guys are stopping in Napa before your dome trek (which
 is
 why I thought I could give you a check immediately!).  Is that the case?
 If
 so, I hope you can join us in a nummy little repast!  If not, I will put a
 check in the mail when you let me know the amount.  Unlike some, I always
 carry my checkbook with me!
 
 Those were incredibly beautiful knives that you guys gave Cameron!
