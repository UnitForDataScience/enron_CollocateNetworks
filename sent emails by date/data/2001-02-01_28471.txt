 I thought the officers had discussed this with Danny quite some time ago, as 
 the organization of the company was set in motion in early Dec.
 
 Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp. has been organized as a wholly-owned 
 subsidiary of ETS for the purpose of transportation capacity management.  The 
 officers are the same as the slate of officers of Transwestern.   The company 
 will neither buy or sell gas nor use transportation capacity.  However, it 
 does plan to enter into natural gas transportation contracts (and resell the 
 capacity thru capacity release).  That is why the creditworthiness question 
 has come up.
 I really don't have any information so send you, unless you want to see the 
 organizational documents.  Steve Harris can answer any business-related 
 questions you have.  Or, I'll be happy to try to answer any other questions.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 Susan, maybe I'm the only one, but I hadn't heard of this new company and 
 what it is to be used for until Mondauy's staff meeting.  What details do we 
 have on this?  can you send me some info on this?  thanks  MK

 Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
 satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
 transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
 Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
 would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
 the guarantee.
