 Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I 
 had a blast with you being here.
 
 I hope that you didn't get sick   you really saw him at his 
 worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on 
 the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.
 
 I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the 
 rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more 
 fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.
 
 gotta go.
 
 Michelle
