 I don't know who you may know on the trading side.  Goldman Sachs is looking
 for a Senior Power Trader, paying anywhere from 150-180 on a base salary
 with the bonus ranging anywhere from 3-500k.  They will guarantee the
 compensation for the first year.  Do you know of anyone falling out there
 who might be interested?  I appreciate the referrals.
 Thanks,
 Rosanna
