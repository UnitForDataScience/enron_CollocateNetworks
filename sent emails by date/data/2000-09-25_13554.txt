 out/tied up the rest of this week.  I am fine if you want to call her.  My 
 only caution would be that you give her data only about our structure

 Mary, the above called Peggy Menchaca (who passed the message to me.) They 
 are in the process of doing a benchmarking study on non-compete clauses. 
 Could you help them out?
