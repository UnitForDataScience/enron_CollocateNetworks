 Vince, 
 
 We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction, now that the forex desk 
 has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market. 
 
 Further to my voicemail, our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve 
 on the PSE swap.  They are currently using 9.5% fixed based on the 1 year 
 implied volatility.  Volatility of USD/DM has been in the range of between 7% 
 and 11%.  Can one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year 
 volalatility number for USD/Euro.  Ideally, we would like a fast turnaround.  
 
 In addition, is there someone who could consider the correlation between US 
 CPI and the $/euro exchange rate.  The credit guys are currently assuming 
 that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the 
 credit reserve on this basis too.  
 
 Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide.
