 Kim,
 As we discussed and agreed, we continue to plan on having the Transwestern meter for the new interconnect into Southern Trails located on our property at Blanco.  Will are planning for Transwestern to tie into it's pipeline and extend piping over to our site where the meter will be located.  Transwestern may need to aquire a small length of right-of-way from El Paso that will connect the TW property to the site we are getting from El Paso.  TW personel will have unlimited acess to this site.
 We will create a lease agreement to lease the footprint for the meter to TW. 
 As we discussed, this facility must be in operation on May1, 2002. 
 Thank you for all your help.
 Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
 Gaylen
