 the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
 projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
 month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
 attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
 the total net buyout to $78,946.? 
 
 We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
 offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
 offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
 prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
 If this is your 
 
 
 
 choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
 Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
 draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
 Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
 amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.
 
 Thank you.
