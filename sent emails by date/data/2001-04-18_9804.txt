 All,
 
 Starting with the April accounting month Corp is cutting a day off of our close process as part of Project Sunrise.  This means that we will have only five days to get all activity booked.  I will be calling a meeting for later this week or early next week to discuss any issues that may arise from this and future implications of Project Sunrise.  Feel free to call if you have any questions.
