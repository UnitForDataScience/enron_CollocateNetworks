 			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word

 ?	By Andy Katz

 	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
 between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
 of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
 	
 	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
 heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
 camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
 talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
 projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
 	
 	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
 could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
 in Chicago.
 	
 	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
 chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
 Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
 Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
 Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
 guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
 junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
 forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
 	
 	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
 month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
 decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
 June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
 Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
 happens.
 	
 	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
 draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	Chris Mihm
 	
 	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
 	
 	1. New Jersey  Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
 where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
 Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
 Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.
