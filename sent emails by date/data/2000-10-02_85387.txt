 request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their 
 obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period 
 prior to the effect date of the agreement.  
 
 Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your 
 discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his 
 notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.  
 
 Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.

 Did you see this Gerald.  They have taken out one of our compressors.  Should 
 I call Kent Harris?

 Attached is the production report.
 We are still having high line pressures.
 I will call you after I speak with Wildhorse this morning.
