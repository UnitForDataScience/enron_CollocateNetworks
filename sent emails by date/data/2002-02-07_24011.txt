 I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
  
 Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
  
 Thanks-
 Davis
