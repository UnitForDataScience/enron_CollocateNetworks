 Attached, please find a copy of questions and answers on the Norton Energy
 
 Storage project.  These, along with the materials presented during the
 
 pre-bid meeting, address all of the issues that have been presented to the
 
 Owners during the bidding process. To allow for adequate review of the
 
 responses, the proposal due date has been extended.
 
 PROPOSALS ARE NOW DUE ON FRIDAY, JUNE 1st.
 
 Norton Energy Storage, LLC is very interested in receiving a proposal from
 
 you.  Proposals could be unconventional, products that don't exist in the
 
 market today but are worthwhile and of value in ECAR; conventional,
 
 standard and existing products; and/or electric tolling.  This is a unique
 
 plant and we are looking for forward-thinking, creative ideas.
 
 If you have any further questions, please contact me as soon as possible.
 
 Thank you for your interest in the Norton Energy Storage project.
