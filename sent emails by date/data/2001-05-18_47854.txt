 I will have your bike and helmet in the car and drop it by your house if you
 like.
 
 What is Holly's email?
 
 Looking forward to seeing you.
 
 
 
 

 
  
 
 
 Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to
 get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been
 thinking about you.  Hope all is going well.

 Miss Tana,
 
 Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
 thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.
 
 I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
 10, or whatever...
 
 Let me know.
 
 Patti
