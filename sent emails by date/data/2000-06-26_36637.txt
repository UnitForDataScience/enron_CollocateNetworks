 I had the answer for you.
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 	
 	

 	
 




  
 Richard, Lee, and myself met this afternoon and reviewed the memo I prepared 
 intending to find and propose a solution
 to our existing valuation problem.   We think we have the answer.  We would 
 appreciate any comments from our risk experts.
 
 The following change to our existing deal is what we think will solve the 
 problem.  All that we are doing is changing the fixed
 price on Legs 2 and 3 to 0.  If you refer to the example mentioned in my 
 earlier memo, you will note that the p/l attributable to 
 this deals should be 52,777; by changing these legs to 0 we accomplish this 
 end result.  
 
      
 
 I look forward to any feedback any of you may have to offer.
