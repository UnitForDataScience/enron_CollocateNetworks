 Whew...!!!  As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.  I 
 have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the 
 computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and 
 paper approvals until late this week/early next week.  After reviewing 
 thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling 
 people without my systems in place!
