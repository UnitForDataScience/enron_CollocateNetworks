 The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
 provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
 The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
 stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
 Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
 the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory 
 services" to the state. 
 That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
 administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
 company interests. 
 The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
 longer contract.
