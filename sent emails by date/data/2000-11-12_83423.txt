 Scott:
 
 This is very kind of you and I really appreciate it very much.  I shall phone 
 you to thank you on behalf of my family and myself as a stop gap measure till 
 I am back from India by 1st week of December to thank you in person.
 
 The lawyer has asked me to compile all the letters, thus kindly send it by 
 internal mail to Amr Ibrahim, EB4737B.  Finally, strange as it might sound, 
 the lawyer has spelled my first name in the letter wrongly as "Amir", and I 
 wonder if there is still time to correct it to "Amr" without the "i".  If 
 this is a bit late, then it is fine as it stands.  
 
 Once more, thank you very, and I really appreciate it.
 
 Very best regards

 I hope that all is well.  India is still going strong with additional 
 involvement in commodity trading (electricity, fuels...etc.)  
 
 Please advice of the best time to phone you this week to seek your help in 
 reference to compiling letters of recommendation for the Green Card 
 application.  The application, supported by Enron, will be under the "Alien 
 of Extraordinary Ability" Category.   I am sure that your recommendation will 
 go a very long way and I am hopeful that you will agree to help.  
 
 I am enclosing the email I received from the lawyer and the sample letter 
 suggested. I am trying to highlight
