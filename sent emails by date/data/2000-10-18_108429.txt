 ask him what he thinks
 
 

 
  
 Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are 
 having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe 
 that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting 
 together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so 
 expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas 
 for panelists?
