 As you can imagine, most information and procedures on the floor are 
 extremely confidential.  We look at the gas market uniquely and using 
 different tools than anybody else.  It is one of our competitive advantages.  
 I'm hesistant to approve the use of any documents for external purposes.  
 If you provide more information about what you're trying to show, who the 
 target audience is, and what format it will be presented, I may be able to 
 help you.

 Hi Kal,
  Here are some screen shots, let me know if they will work for you.  I think 
 we may need to double check with John Arnold- the trader- before using them 
 for sure.  But I was told they would be okay.
