 i missed yoga last night too - do you want to try to YIM this weekend?  saturday night sounds good.  i'm not sure what's going on with crantina and its not too personal nor a secret.  i'll pass the book along to jai.  are you working at earls again this w/e to support your shooter-lifestyle?  - c -

 glad to hear you are finally putting in an honest day's work!  let me know 
 if you're planning on going to yoga tomorrow (wed).  i did like tuesdays 
 with morrie, do you want me to pass it on to jai or give it back to you? 
 are you still planning your wine event on saturday?  i want to come, but i 
 think jai is going to a hockey game for work that night.  hopefully i see 
 you tomorrow night at yoga.
