 Liz Orr with Wildhorse just called to inform me we cannot nominate into 
 NWPL.   Her legal department has informed her there are issues with the 
 contract and until they inform her otherwise, our gas can only flow into 
 Questar.   Physically, we can flow into NWPL but contractully we cannot.
 
 We have changed the nominations back to Questar for tomorrow's gas day.
 
 Sorry about that, (we tried)
 
 Theresa
