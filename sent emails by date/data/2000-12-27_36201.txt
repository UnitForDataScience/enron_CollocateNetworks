 I do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have 
 used:
 
 - Do you understand what curveshift is?  If so ... Price today was $10.20 and 
 yesterday it was $10.13 ... what was my curveshift?
 - What makes up a P&L statement?
 - What is MTM accounting?  accrual accounting?
 - If they have knowledge of options, what is a delta position?
 
 I guess these are more general analytical questions:
 
 - Give me an example of an problem you've had and how you solved it?
 - The "eight ball" question (basic problem solving)
 - The "light switch" question (advanced problem solving)
 
 When I interview I am looking for trainability, better than average problem 
 solving skills and a desire to work in this environment.  If the candidate 
 has these skills then I believe we can teach them what they need to know.  I 
 also think it is candidates with these basic attributes that are a better fit 
 for us.  They know they don't know everything (about Risk) and work hard to 
 get up to speed.
