 1.  Investment of funds should be OK with Enron.  We are not receiving the 
 pre-closing proceeds from escrow.
 
 2.  Paul, can you confirm that wiring instructions in the agreement are 
 suitable.
 
 3.  What fees are reasonable?
 
 
 

 

  
 
 Hi Carolyn,
 
 What does Enron need to do to get the escrow account set up?  Is there
 something Steve needs to do?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
