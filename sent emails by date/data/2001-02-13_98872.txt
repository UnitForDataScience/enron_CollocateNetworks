 Alsosince we are posturing  this

 McKenna as soon as possible to see if there is any additional discovery we
 really need. Let me hear from you'all and then I'll ask Tom to contact the
 other arbitrators about their availability and the preparation of some kind
 of scheduling order for discovery, motions, etc. deadlines.
