 not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill 
 in the blanks.  I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA 
 seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree 
 to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.  Thanks.  Sara
