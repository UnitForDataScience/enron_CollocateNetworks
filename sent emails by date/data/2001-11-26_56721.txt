 "I've always heard," Jake said to Pete, "that God will answer prayer,
 But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there.
 
 Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others?
 That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers.
 
 Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason?
 Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season.
 
 Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel,
 And I was wonderin', could you tell me - what the heck's the deal?"
 
 Peter listened very patiently and when Jake was done,
 There were smiles of recognition, and he said, "So, you're the one!
 
 That day your truck wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a flyin',
 You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a tryin',
 
 A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file,
 But you know, Jake - - - we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.
 
 And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota,
 He didn't recognize your voice... and started a truck in South Dakota.
 
 So, remember to keep in touch!
