 They have been fighting with the CFTC to keep it from extending its 
 jurisdiction to Enron Online and to all the financial products Enron sells.   
 We apparently have a bill pending to lock the CFTC in and keep it from going 
 after energy-related financial products.  Cynthia was not aware of any 
 potential collaboration between CFTC and FERC designed to push FERC into the 
 role of regulator of these markets (with CFTC pulling the strings behind the 
 scenes).  Cynthia was cranky about this possibility and will follow up.

 Dan also made a comment when we were chatting that the trading floor and EOL 
 tour was "discouraging in a way" because they were not yet prepared to 
 regulate such activities. I thought it was kind of frightening that he feels 
 they need to regulate such a free market, although it was not clear exactly 
 what he meant and I was not able to pursue it with him.
