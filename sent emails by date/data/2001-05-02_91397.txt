  in California. The utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power brought from across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucets and zaps electricity off to California. 
 ''We spill water during the day,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Why? Is it because we can make more money? No. It's because that is when everybody wants electricity, for God's sake.'' 
 Questions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in the Northwest may soon be moot. Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff so far this year to about half of what is considered normal. 
 The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for natural-gas-fired power plants and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capacity to generate it. 
 ''Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates,'' said Paul Norman, head of power operations at Bonneville. 
 Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, Mr. Norman warned that by late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive end.
