 All,
 
 The last information I had on Benefits was that Enron benefits would cease on Feb. 8 and UBS benefits would start on Feb. 16.
 
 Obviously, there is a gap here, and UBS/Enron are working to put something in place to cover this period.
 
 If you have anything elective, you might find that it would be simpler if you were to avoid this gap period.
