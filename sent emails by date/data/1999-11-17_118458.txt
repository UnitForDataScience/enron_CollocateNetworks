 the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there - just 
 barely east of due south of the BVI.  They are predicting that it will resume 
 its course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.  As of 
 the middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the Friday 
 charter starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's!
 
 
 
 



  
 
 
 AA is fine - St Thomas.  All we need to do now is make sure there are
 islands left to fly into.
 
 Thanks,
