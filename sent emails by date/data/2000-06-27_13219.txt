 If you are sure you don't want reimbursement, then thanks a lot!!!  I hope 
 that you both can join us.  If not, let's plan on another arrangement.  We 
 are planning to stay at the Doubletree Suites in/near Georgetown (apparently, 
 it is close to the Watergate).  It was way less expensive than the Embassy 
 Suites we discussed the other day (approx. $100 per night!).  We are renting 
 a car, though, so we can get around wherever we need to  along
 the third baseline above the visitor's dugout.  Game time is 7:35 p.m.  I'll
 send the tickets down to you in the next day or two.  Have fun!
