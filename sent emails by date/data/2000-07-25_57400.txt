 Bob Vastine reports that Robert Madellin will be moving from the Services
 portfolio this fall to Agriculture and some other high sounding
 responsibility. He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servoz
 as number 2. Does anyone have biographical information on Herve
 Jouanjean???
 
 Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here for
 meetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI and
 Japaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energy
 interest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed no
 interest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be an
 opportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of their
 interests and possibly the drilling people.
 
 During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that the
 WTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern with
 the recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions and
 in the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are price
 controls.  We were told that a number of law firms in Washington are
 opposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informed
 ISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls.
 
 Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the China
 accession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues.  You need to let us
 know if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controls
 for energy services and e-commerce services.
