 We met with OSM and have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
 proposed structures hopefully to be followed by specific pricing.  We're 
 talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8 
 months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a "reminder", as 
 if and when we're able to agree upon pricing and a proposed structure we'll 
 need to "paper" it by weeks end.  At this time we could be going either 
 physically or financially.  Thanks,  John
