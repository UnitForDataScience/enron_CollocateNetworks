 I hope the packing and other move-related things are going wellI really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with 
 everyone.  I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by 
 phone.  Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule:  "Family and 
 relationships first!"
 
 Hope all is well.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
