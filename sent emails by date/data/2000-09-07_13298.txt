  to be defined), Buyer shall inform Seller, which will have the right 
 to re-employ the employee at Enron, with credited service.
 For employees with less than 5 years of service, some concession for unvested 
 portion of Cash Balance Plan may be necessary.
 
 Open issues/questions include:
 
 Equity:  What is to be done with unvested equity?  For example, in December, 
 every Enron employee will be granted stock options worth 25% of their base 
 salary (based on the Black-Scholes valuation).  Also, persons with other 
 equity grants may forfeit those grants upon closing.  An evaluation of the 
 various plans and participants will be necessary to determine exactly where 
 any issues exist, as well as possible resolutions of those issues.  In light 
 of the appreciation in Enron's stock, this equity issue may be significant.
 Pension:  What will happen to hired employees with potential eligibility 
 under Enron's pension plan?
 
 If you have any questions about these issues, please give me a call at x 
 3-6401.  If I receive additional feedback, I will let you know.
 
 Thanks.
