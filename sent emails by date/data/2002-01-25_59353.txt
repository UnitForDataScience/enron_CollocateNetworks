 I don't have any contacts at Duke.  Kelly Little will be working there, but other than that I don't know anyone.  Have you called Scott Neal back yet?  We were just talking about that exact thing, we knew all the weather guys left and were wondering what they would do.  That would be a great opportunity for you.
