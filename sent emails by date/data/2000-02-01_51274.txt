 Chris can set up a conference call with myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu 
 to discuss
 the real option applications. My assistant Shirley Crenshaw, 3-5290, will be 
 glad to help him.

 Per my voicemail, the following is the message I received from Chris Swenson 
 about the Kellogg Class he is trying to form.  Please let me know if you 
 would be able to help him.  Thanks.

  who knows, Enron might actually like the
 free exposure.
 
 
 All the best,
