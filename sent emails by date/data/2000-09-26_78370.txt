 Hello Lisa
 I wanted to contact you to let you know that we (ENA West) are attemtping to 
 help the ENA San Francisco guys locate a Generator Step Up Transformer for 
 the Pleasanton project.  ENA is responsible to bring an LM6000 and GSU to the 
 project.  We cannot use one of the ABB transformers (Don Hammond checked with 
 ABB, and the as built configuration simply cannot be used or changed to meet 
 the needs of ENA SFO's application.  As such, we have had to go out and find 
 a GSU.  The good news is we have found one through GE.  It will meet SFO's 
 delivery schedule.  We have not received a quote, nor have we signed anything 
 (but we want to ASAP).  In talking to Dale Rasmussen, I understand we would 
 need to purchase this major component through a West LB structure.  GE 
 prefers to sell us the GSU through ENA's existing contract with GE.  As such, 
 I am asking what steps you (or Kay) would like us to take in setting up a 
 purchase option (or whatever is the correct noun name for reserving, buying a 
 needed GSU in a timely manner).
 
 This e mail is meant to be a starting point in dialog.  Please contact me on 
 Tuesday to discuss whatever is necessary.
 
 Thanks.
