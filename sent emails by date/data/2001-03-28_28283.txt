 I need to get on msoft outlook asap and get off lotus notes.  To accomplish 
 that, I'd like CMS contract approval emails to go to Tony for the south end 
 end and Dari for the North end, for discussion with me orally and approval on 
 their computers.  Can we do this??   If not, we need a better system that 
 allows me to get off lotus notes.  thanks. df
