 which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the
 weighted average measured by the equities utilized.  Oil, gas and electricty
 are
 good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of
 the
 value chain. Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata,
 but
 what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a
 vertically integrated company?
 
 *** Two-b: based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is
 being
 proposed for a new business venture (some new unexploited opportunity,)
 there is
 some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new
 ventures and the high risk of failure.  This skepticism is likely to be less
 acute in high-tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded
 before us daily by NASDQ touts.  It is a much harder sell to "mature"
 industries.
 
 Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around
 opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas
 sectors
 as regulation is removed.  A large proportion of the risk is embedded in
 ongoing
 changes of public policy on an international basis.  As an intentionally
 screwed-up example, can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses
 volatility for U.S. companies investing in seed projects in Mexico based on
 speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility (CFE) and
 PEMEX?
