 referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
 obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
 issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
 for the past few weeks. 
 
 Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
 desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
 possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
 Am I missing something?
 
 As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
 properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
 simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
 this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
 their jobs - do you know anything about that?
 
 I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
 Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
 any way.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
