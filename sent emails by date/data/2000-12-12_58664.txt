 but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be 
 called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence 
 to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
 are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
 suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, 
 customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, 
 so there is no demand response when prices rise.  
 
 On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.  
 Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?

 Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:
 
 1. General
 May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
 same ones causing the electric problem





  
  
 Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
 gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
 Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
 supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
 that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.
