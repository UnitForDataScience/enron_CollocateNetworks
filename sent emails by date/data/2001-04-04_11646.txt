 Jane,
 
 I asked Paul and Jim if there was a problem with doing a deal with Flying Crocodile, and the response was that we will deal with them so long as they contractually agree that they will not use the capacity for any unlawful purpose (which is a standard clause in our agreement).  Therefore, we will move ahead with this.  As I told you earlier, the mark on the long-haul is likely to be negative, and it is an on-net circuit so we can absorb it back if they default.  The local loop is off-net, so I would imagine that you will want some protection on that side.  Let me know if you need anything else from me.
 
 Thanks,
 BG
