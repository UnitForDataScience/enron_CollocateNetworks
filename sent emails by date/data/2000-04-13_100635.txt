 and I feel honored that I got to accompany Grayson on her first restaurant 
 mission.  Hopefully the french-fry smell did not throw her off her feeding 
 schedule to badly.  Got a message from Mema wanting to discuss the baby's 
 bottle habits.  Pu-lease!  If it's OK with everyone I will try to bring Bill 
 at Easter as a distraction.
 
 This weekend I am supposed to drive to Austin to pick up Bill and his friends 
 (aka Team Slacker) at the end of the MS 150.  I'll be driving someone's SUV.  
 If manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver (by Bill and the owner 
 of the SUV) do not improve, however, Team Slacker will be taking the bus home.
 
 Do you remember Rob Carty from high school?  I just saw him at a seminar 
 given by Akin Gump for in-house lawyers.  He works for Exxon/Mobil now.  I 
 barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty!

 Take care and drop me a line when you can.
 
 Love,
