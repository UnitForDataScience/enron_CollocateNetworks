 Dear Vince:
 
 How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
 me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
 having been working for Williams for about two years,
 now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
 great company, I am wondering whether there is any
 opportunity for me, either in research group or in
 structure group
 
 Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
 got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
 University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
 company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
 and in charge of the quantitative research group with
 7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
 research and modeling about electricity,
 load-following deal and tolling deals.
 
 If you need any additional information, please feel
 free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
 hearing from you soon, thank you.
 
 sincerely,
 Charles
