 I just wanted to make sure that you knew that Ken does plan to do this.  He 
 did talk to Governor Knowles.
 
 Thanks.

 Dear Ken, 
 
 It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
 Aspen.? I'm working at it! 
 
 Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
 by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
 Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
 has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
 natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues  to have 
 you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.
 
 It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 
 
 Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
 large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
 further on what they would like to accomplish.
 
 If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
 that would be great. 
 
 On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 
 
 Best, 
 
 Dan
