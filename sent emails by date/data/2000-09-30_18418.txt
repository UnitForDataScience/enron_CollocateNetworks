 again.  Remember, life's too short to get too worried about it.  Let me know 
 what works for you.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 PS  I'm spending my Saturday nite working on a financial reporting case.  
 Hope that's modest consolation.
 
 "Strategizing?!"   (I don't think so.)

 Boy did I flake on the happy hour.  Jeff-I think I've
 gone over THE edge.  Hectic does't even work anymore. 
  I'm on a (fairly)good project at HP..IN SACRAMENTO,
 in fact 20 miles north of Sacramento. I LOVE the
 company, the learning, the work, the teams, the
 people, the career opportunities.  I hate the 4+ hours
 of driving on Mondays and Tuesdays, strategizing(real
 word?) about balancing the needs of the team with
 getting my ass to school. I really want to talk to
 you...I'm thinking about full time and want your
 thoughts.  Are you available at break on Tuesday for a
 beer?
