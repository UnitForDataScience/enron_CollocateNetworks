 Colleen,
 
 As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
 Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
 Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
 how to best proceed with correcting this situation.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Melissa (703-561-6408)
