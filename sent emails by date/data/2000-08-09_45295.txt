 Gillian and George,
 
 Thanks again for stopping by this morning.  Per our conversation, I am
 attaching a mutual NDA and a standard LOI.  With the former in place, we
 should both be able to get a little deeper into the technology to see if
 there is a strong fit between our respective companies.  I would be very
 interested to introduce our CTO with your technology counterpart the next
 time he is in town.  Feel free to schedule that meeting through me.  All the
 best.
 
 
 Regards,
 Anupam
