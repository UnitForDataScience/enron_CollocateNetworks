 2:15 would be good.  My flight gets into Reagan at  12:00: if it is delayed I will give you a call.  Thank you,
 
 Larry May
 
  

    
 Larry,
 
      I am available from 9:30 to 11:00 and from 2 to 3:00 on the 24th so give
 me a time within that timeframe and I'll be here at 302 Stuart Hall, 2013 G
 Street.  I can't print out your resume and cover letter so bring copies.
 Regards

 >I spoke with you a few days ago concerning my interest in the Sercurity
 Policy Studies program.  I am going to be visiting the GW campus the afternoon
 of Thursday Jan 24th and would like to know if you would be available for a
 few minutes.  Also, you had mentioned you may be able to pass on my resume so
 I am attaching a cover letter and resume (the cover letter better explains the
 relevance my business and military experience to an intelligence position).
 Ljmay1.doc is the cover letter and ljmay2.doc is the resume.  Thank you for
 your consideration.
