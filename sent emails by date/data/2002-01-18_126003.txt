 WOW, that was higher than I thought.  That is not much different than mine and higher than other Directors in the office.  I am not blowing smoke, but given my experience, there is nothing that I can do at the immediate time.

 Just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  The only concern I have is with the base number.  Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.
 
 I would like to talk about this on Monday, after I have had a chance to look at the paper in full.
