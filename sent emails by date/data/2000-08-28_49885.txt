                             Hello  Mr. Kaminski,
 
                                Can we  meet for a quick lunch again at your 
 convenience? Just to bring you up to date about my search for the right 
 opportunity. Also I noticed in the Risk magazine that Enron Investment 
 Partners and AIG have joined TreasuryConnect as strategic partners to 
 capitalize on internet-based transaction execution of financial derivatives. 
 I would like to explore if I can be any help to Hank Finkenstaedt, the 
 Director of Enron Investment Partners.
 
                             Please let me know what day and time might be 
 convenient for you.
 
 
 Thank you.
 
 Sincerely,
