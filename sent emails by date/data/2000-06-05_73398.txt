 David:  do you have the electronic file of the "MOU" for Cogen Tech.  If so, 
 please provide to kay Mann per the request below.  I would be willing to bet 
 that Mike Miller and ENA legal have the whole file.  We entered into the 
 picture after the MOU was executed and only received hard copies.
  
 

 

  
 Hi Jeff,
 
 I'm preparing the letter agreement regarding payment.  Can you help me with
 the name and address to use?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
