 Hello
  
 I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.  
 I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.
  
 Thanks
  
 Louise
