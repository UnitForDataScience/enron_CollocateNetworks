 >    Mark Lay:  I shared confidentially with Vince Kaminski my developing
 >    concept of a highly inefficient not-for-profit enterprise with
 >    dramatically increasing costs.  I believe that a for-profit economic
 >    model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
 >    ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
 >    impact of health care costs.   Vince seems to also believe in the
 >    concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has
 >    already asked to become involved.   I would like involve more people
 >    with vision, means and desire to help make this a reality.  I would look
 >    forward to meeting with you to talk further.  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158
