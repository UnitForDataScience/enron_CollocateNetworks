 The following illustrious FERC group will be with us on 31 the morning of 
 Dec. 7.  They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems 
 that track OASIS and market information.  Many of them have not seen EOL, so 
 we need to show them that as well.
 
 The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means 
 that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.  They will be 
 visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.
 
 They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have 
 given them in the past Manager of 
 Information Technology), Scott Miller (Director, Energy Market and Director 
 of the Staff Investigations issued last month), Thomas  Brownfield (works for 
 Scott Miller), and Karen Robinson (in Strategy and Organizational Management).
 ?
 Please contact me should you have any other  questions.

 Thanks, 
 Scott Miller
 Director, Energy Markets
