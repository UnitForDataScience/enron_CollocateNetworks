 1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the 
 effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much 
 as it is a relationship issue.
 
 2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I 
 doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They 
 really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to 
 the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.

 Gaurav asked me to summarize all relevant risks associated with the Reliable 
 Power Product for the Dash.  Please let me know if you think I should add or 
 revise anything:
 
 1.  Section 8.3 indemnity obligation  If the price we use to pay a counterparty 
 under the swap is subsequently corrected by the floating price source, we may 
 be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the 
 insurer makes a payment to us for the loss adjustment.  However, if the price 
 adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may 
 have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actually get a 
 refund from our counterparty.
 
 5.  Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breach 
 of our duties under the policy.  For instance, if we fail to comply with the 
 notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.  
 However, we will still be required to pay out on the underlying swap.
