
 
 I just received a message from Anna Chung (?) at Merrill re: the ENE master.  
 Her number is 212-449-7494.  I also left vm for Jeff to send down deemed 
 ISDA's or other confirms.  SS
 
 
 


   
 
 
 
 
 If you want to send them over, send them to me and I'll nominate someone to
 oversee it. The guy that runs or legal side is called Harry Stanley on the 
 same
 fax number, but I would address it to me and I'll forward it and make sure 
 they
 understand the background. Is that OK ?

 Can I get a contact name and number in your documentation department?  There 
 has
 been a change of personnel on my side.
 
 
 Thanks
