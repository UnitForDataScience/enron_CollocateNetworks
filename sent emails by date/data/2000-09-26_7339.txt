  on the cover note ?  
 
 I think the note is fine. My concern would be access to details of the 
 standards themselves. People will be less inclined to come to you and me, but 
 they may well click on an intranet link to the policies and procedures 
 website for example.
 
 For your consideration.
 
 Thanks
 
 Fernley

  the cover note ?
 
 Fernley  / Sally
 
 Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
 communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
 summary ).
 
 We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
 for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
 Enron Europe newsletter )
 
 Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
 
 Mike
