 Susan,
 
 Please find attached for your review, a Consent to Assignment Agreement
 between us, Enron North America Corporation and Morgan Stanley Capital Group
 Inc.  We would like to have the document ready to execute at about the same
 time we execute the Physical Power Consent to Assignment Agreement with
 Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and we are waiting for FERC approval on the
 Physical Power Sales as well.  I just wanted to present the agreement to you
 now, so that if it is necessary, we have time to discuss any concerns.  I
 look forward to talking with you to work toward the execution of the
 Agreement.
