 I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated 
 during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it 
 is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for 
 this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

 Daren,
 
 Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all 
 new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  
 Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks.
 
 Bob
