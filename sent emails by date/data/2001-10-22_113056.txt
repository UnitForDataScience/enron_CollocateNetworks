 The meeting with the Committee will be held in Nashville on October 18th.  Instead of 30 minutes, we will have 60 minutes.  Following our presentation, the Tennessee distributors
 will have 30 minutes.  We are welcome to stay for the distributors' presentation.  The continental breakfast/registration will begin at 9:30 a.m.
  Our presentation will begin at 10:00 a.m.  The distributors will begin their
 presentation at 11:00 a.m.
 
 I hope you'll be able to join the conference call on Friday, September 28th at 11:00 a.m. EDT to discuss how to use our 60 minutes.  To access the call, please dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the EPSA/Samantha Slater call.  Please make sure to ask for the Samantha Slater call, since we will have two EPSA calls going on at the same time.
 
 Thanks!
