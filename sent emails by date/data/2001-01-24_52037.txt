 I was delayed on my wait out. I probably hit the stop at
 6:15.
 
 Let me buy you a coffee this afternoon. What about 2:00?

 Vince,
 
 I was at the bus-stop from 5:50 to 6:10 ish, assumed you had been delayed and 
 jumped on the next Research Forest bus that came along.
 
 I hope you didn't wait around for me?
 
 regards
 
 Steve
