  while others do 
 little, if anything, to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids 
 according to age groups.  Our kids knew how old they were, and the 
 season their birthday was in...but I suspect that was ONLY because 
 they were each in foster care and celebrated a birthday with their 
 foster families just before their adoptions.
