 We are getting ready to do a public launch of Enron Direct.  When I was in Toronto Jeff Borg said that Enron Canada marketed 50% of the gas produced in Alberta. 
 1.  Do you have a feel for the actual % of gas ?
 2.  Can we publically make this representation?  
 
 Would it be possible to get a copy of the fundamentals that one of your analysts puts together for the morning meeting? 
 
 Many thanks
 Kate
