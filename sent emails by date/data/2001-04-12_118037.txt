 I have no legal objections to the presentation.  I do have to wonder if it is 
 wise from a commercial perspective to so heavily emphasize the importance of 
 the success of EnronOnline to the company's business on the platform itself.

  This is a Windows Media Player file  
 
 The existing presentation (if you'd like to see it for comparison) is at 
 http://www.enrononline.com/docs/marketing/Markets/ - click on Presentations / 
 Enron Overview in the left-hand navigation.
 
 This is Skilling's "standard" presentation, so there is nothing in it which 
 has not already been presented publicly before.
 
 Please let me know if these files have your approval for the EnronOnline 
 site, or contact me if you have any questions or comments.
 
 Thanks,
