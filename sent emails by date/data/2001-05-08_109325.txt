 Colin,
 
 Can you get me the XML schemas or DTDs for EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.SITARA and EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.TAGG?
 
 I need to figure out the mappings for conterparty id, price, volume, etc.
 
 Attached are the msgs captured on the TIB.
  << File: TAGG.txt >>  << File: SITARA.txt >> 
 
 Thanks,
