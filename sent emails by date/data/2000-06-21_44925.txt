 original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the 
 future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that 
 might be responsible for filing original guarantees.
 
 

   
 Just a followup note:
 
 We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original 
 incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have 
 been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of 
 using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I 
 think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to 
 the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my 
 question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, 
 to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).
