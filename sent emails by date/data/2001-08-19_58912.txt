Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth

 Mr. Skilling consistently stated over the past few months that we needed to "earn our way" to a higher stock price.  Following his departure, Mr. Lay has stated that one of his top priorities would be to rebuild our stock value.  My question is, will the company have any changes to existing policies in order to facilitate this growth?  Will company spending (Teaming events, Travel and Expense Policy, Investment in new technology, and so on) be cut back in order to bolster earnings?  Basically, do we have a new gameplan (aside from the EBS restructuring) or will we proceed forward and operate as we have been.
