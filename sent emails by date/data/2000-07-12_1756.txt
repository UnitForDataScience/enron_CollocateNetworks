     (a) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents diluted
 earnings
         per share before the impact of certain non-recurring charges.
 Second
         quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million
         pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.  Second quarter 1999 results
         exclude merger related charges of  $(131) million pretax, or
         $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million
         pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory
         issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date
         2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East
         Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger
         related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.
         Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
         accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
 of
         $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test

     (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
         earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
         common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
         the amount of loss per share.
