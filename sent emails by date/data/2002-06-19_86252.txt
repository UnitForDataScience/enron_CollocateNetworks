 Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?
  
 If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.
  
 Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?
  
 Chad, the time in the "stall" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.
