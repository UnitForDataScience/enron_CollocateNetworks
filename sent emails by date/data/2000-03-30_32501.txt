 not be paid to them.  Deal 136863 they say should be paid to Aviare Energy.  
 Deal 136835 and deal 136845 they say should be paid to Hassie Hunt.  Can you 
 tell me who we are suppose to pay for these meters?  Their payment is due on 
 Monday, so whatever you can tell me today would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
 Megan
