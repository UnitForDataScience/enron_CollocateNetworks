 Kelli,
 
 I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.
