 Thanks.
 
  
     
 
 I am currently building a spreadsheet to manage this information but know that it is important to get this out ASAP.  This is obviously very sensitive information, who should be copied?
 
 These are the potential P&L impacts from Project Phoenix rebookings by the end of Q3:
 
 
 			Gas		Power		Option		Total
 
 Starwood						-4.5		-4.5MM
 
 Chase					-20.0		+7.0		-13.0MM
 
 Springs			+1.0		-12.0				-11.0MM
 
 Tyco			TBD		-8.0				-8.0MM
 
 	Total			+1.0MM	-40.0MM	+2.5MM	-36.5MM
 
 
 You have each received the summary of issues with Starwood and Tyco.  A conversation regarding Springs is scheduled for this week.  Chase is a few days away but the magnitude of the impact is large enough that I wanted to highlight it now.  These are based upon best estimates to this point, I am attempting to establish the confidence interval on Chase and Springs power positions.
 
 Hopefully we will be able to finalize rebookings of these transactions by the end of the quarter, along with MFG, Quebecor and Owens Illinois.
 
 Please let me know if there are any questions.
 
 Terry
