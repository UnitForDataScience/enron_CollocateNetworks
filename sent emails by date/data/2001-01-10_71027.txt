 oppose the Master Sales proposal on the grounds that : (1) the approval of
 transactions with an affiliate (without complete definition of all terms)
 raises a potential for abuse; (2) staff perceives that it will be unable to
 ensure that abuse does not occur; and (3) because the transactions under
 the agreement are in a competitive market, the addition of enovate as one
 more participant in the market with have little incremental effect on
 Peoples' operation, i.e., enovate is just one more participant among the
 many existing players. (Note that Peoples data responses seem to suggest
 the view reflected in item 3.)  There is a status hearing at 11:00am today
 which should cover only scheduling. It is unliokely that any substantive
 position will be taken today. The schedule is likely to call for some
 additional discovery followed by a filing date for staff's evidence abd
 recommendation. Peoples will have an opportunity to file "rebuttal" to
 staff's position.  I will let you know later what happens at the hearing.
