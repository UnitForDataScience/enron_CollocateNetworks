 You have two cows.
 
 You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
 credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
 swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back,
 with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
 transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by
 the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your
 listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an
 option on one more.
