 I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power
 Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the
 capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak
 = $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus
 Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh,
 Off Peak = $43.60/MWh.
 
 Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward
 it others in your shop.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ketan
 
 
 
 

 


 
  
 
 Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if
 Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January
 2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of
 February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should
 be sent to Consumers Energy.
 
 In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct
 capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and
 requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the
 correct capacity charge.
 
 Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further.
 
 Kind regards.
