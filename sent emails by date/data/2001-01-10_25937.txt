 Daren - After checking with MIPS, you are correct.  Jan. 1 only flowed 19 
 dth.  The 5882 dth was a bad estimate.  A better estimate was received on 
 1/7/00.
 Sorry about all the confusion.

 Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day 
 1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal # 
 506192) or create a new one?  Thanks.
