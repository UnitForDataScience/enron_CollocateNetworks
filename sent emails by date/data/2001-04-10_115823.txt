 Can you please modify that deal that you made the price $140 yesterday to 
 make it for the 6th only?  The 7th is all at $150.
 
 Thanks

 Chris,
 One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 

 per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
 lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
 week.  Have a good weekend.
