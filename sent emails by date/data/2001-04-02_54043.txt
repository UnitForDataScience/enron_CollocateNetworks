 Please, check with Shirley. She keeps my calendar up to date.
 
 Also, we got a 2nd desk for you with the credit group
 on the 23rd floor. You can divide  your time
 bet the 19th floor and the 23rd floor to stay in touch with the
 business unit. Please, check with Vasant and he will introduce you to the
 credit team here in Houston (Jeff Kinneman, Craig Chaney).
 
 Also, please plan for a trip to London in 3-4 weeks.

 Hi,
 
     Thanks for your prompt response.
 
     Nalin Kulatilaka wants to visit when you are in town.  What are good 
 Thursdays for you?
 
 Thanks,

   having options is one thing but exercising them
 and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
 asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
 valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
 real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
 these problems by imposing a market disciplining.
 
 (c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
 credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
 options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
 story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
 Enron has been moving into over the last few years.
 
 On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
 you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
 working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
 wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.
 
 I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
 some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
 room would be very important to me.
 
 As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
 May 3/4 are good for me.
 
 Regards
 
 Nalin
