 > Hi Suanne,
 >
 > I am pleased to attach the revised ISDA Schedule and CSA which contains
 > most of the revisions DLJ requested. I would also like to let you know
 > about the following:
 >
 > 1. Payee Tax Representation: I sent DLJ's suggested clause to my Tax Dep't
 > and they said that feel such language is insufficient to permit us to not
 > have to withhold with respect to interest and dividend payments, each of
 > which could arise during the course of our trading relationship.  My
 > colleague in the Tax Dep't said he would prefer that DLJ certify that it
 > is
 > a foreign taxpayer entitled to receive payments under the document without
 > reduction for withholding or other taxes.  He said that DLJ would not be
 > able to certify to this if the form of the document is the usual very
 > broad
 > form whereby it permits transactions of every type (both on and off market
 > swaps - off market swaps being swaps involving a lending aspect) and thus
 > the underlying document might have to be curtailed.
 >
 > 2. Documents to be Delivered: For the time being, I have made a reference
 > in Part 3 to "Corporate Documents" to be given by DLJ. Please let me know
 > what these will be.
 >
 > 3. Calculation Agent: I still need to get the language from you that makes
 > the both parties the CA.
 >
 > 4. Set-Off: As you requested, I had a look at amending our clause to more
 > closely reflect the ISDA Set-Off Clause but with the inclusion of the
 > Non-Defaulting Party's Affiliates. Upon review - the clause in the
 > document
 > is very similar to the ISDA clause except for the 1st two sentences which
 > bring in the Non-Defaulting Party's Affiliates (which we have agreed to
 > have). The only other sentence in the clause that differs from the ISDA is
 > the one which talks about conversion of the Early Termination Amounts. Our
 > language goes ahead and makes it clear that all amounts need to to be
 > converted to the Termination Currency.  I think that is helpful.
 >
 > Thus I would propose to leave the Set-Off clause unamended.
 >
 > 5. Securities Rep's: We have been able to incorporate these with just a
 > very few minor changes.
 >
 > 6. Resolution Time (CSA): I have discussed this with my Credit Officer and
 > he thinks we really do need to have at least 2 Business Days to resolve a
 > dispute.
 >
 > 7. Transfer of Collateral (all or just undisputed amount): Unfortunately
 > my
 > Credit Officer was unable to agree to transferring the whole amount
 > requested, if part of the amount is in dispute.
 >
 > 8.Holding & Using Posted Collateral: I have reviewed this and the language
 > we have proposed goes a lot further than what is in the printed CSA. For
 > instance there is objective criteria contained in our language which is
 > helpful to the Pledgor since it sets out that a party must have a certain
 > credit rating to hold collateral. Also it sets out where collateral may be
 > held. I would be happy to go through our suggested clause (g) and explain
 > our reasons for asking to leave our proposed language in the CSA Schedule.
 >
 > The only other documents left to resolve are the Guarantees. I look
 > forward
 > to receiving your comments on ours (I believe we agreed to agree on a
 > format and use it for both Guarantees).
 >
 > Kind regards,
 >
