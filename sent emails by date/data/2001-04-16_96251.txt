 I don't have a final brochure on this, but here is a draft.  I've also
 attached my law review article on the EEI Contract.  I can't recall if I
 gave you  one at the WSPP meeting in S.F.  Hope all is going well.  If BPA
 would like me to do a separate presentation on the EEI Contract, I can
 arrange that as well.
