 Yes, thanks
 
  
     
 Brad, 
 
 I did two post-ids. I used the current production port_calc (3.15) to calculate 1389454 and I used the old version(3.14) to calculate 1389464. I do see a P& L change on 1389454.
 
 I debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P& L value. Enclosed is a partial list of those deals. The reasons are: 
 
 In old version(3.14), we calculate volatility of basis options like this
 
 1) we calculate the NG volatility
 2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF- volatility curve. If IF- volatility curve exists, we use IF-volatility curve.
 3) If IF- volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility.
 
 In the current production version(3.15), we calculate volatility of basis options like this
 
 1) we calculate the NG volatility + NG vol skew. (The NG vol skew is based on NG price - fixed price)
 2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF-volatility curve. If IF-volatility curve exists, we use IF- volatility curve.
 3) If IF-volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility + NG vol skew which was calculated in step 1).
 
 The bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step 2), we didn't apply vol skew upon IF vol. In our new fix, this bug will be fixed.
 
 However, the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist. So the current production version (3.15) used the NG vol + NG vol skew for those deals. The old version (3.14) used the NG vol for those deals. Thus you see P&L change in these two versions.
 
 Also we'd like to confirm with you that in the new fix, if the IF vol curve does not exist, you still want us to use NG vol + NG vol skew instead of erroring out. If the IF vol curve exists, we will use IF vol + NG vol skew.
 
 Thanks,
 Jennifer
