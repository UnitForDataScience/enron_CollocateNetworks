 Jeff,
 
 Marty Sunde asked me to get ahold of you as soon as possible to discuss 
 likely exit fee scenarios. Could we talk today?
 
 Thanks,

 Guys, I assume that we are managing all new and old California contracts with 
 this potential issue in mind.  This plus the exit fees could be a significant 
 issue.   Let me know if we need a broader discussion.
 
 Regards
