 wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).  Thanks for the 
 comment on the hearing.  In some respects I don't think the first panel could 
 have gone much better;  everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for 
 different reasons).  The other staff reports are also looking good.  Scott 
 Miller has been a godsend it went 
 decidely downhill after you left.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
