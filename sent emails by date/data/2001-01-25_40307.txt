 by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of 
 it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO 
 West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If 
 we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of 
 like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would 
 try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at 
 least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join.
