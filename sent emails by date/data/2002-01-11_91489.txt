 that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?   
 
 coffee or lunch would be great.  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today, but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time - whenever you're next in town, give me a buzz, or if you're looking for a reason to come into town, how about tuesday or wednesday
