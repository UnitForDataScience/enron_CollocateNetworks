 Your recommendation makes sense. It's a new program and we have no data points
 about its quality.
 
 I shall inform my contact that you have already fully committed your resources
 and cannot make  anymore campus trips. I shall offer to collect the resumes and distribute 
 them within Enron.

 Vince,
 
 As a follow-up to our phone conversation, I am attaching below the URL for
 our QCF program here at Georgia Tech for your corporate recruiting folks.
 http://www.qcf.gatech.edu/
 It will be great if we could have your recruiting people meet with our
 first graduating class of the QCF program.
 
 Regarding your visit, we'd be glad to cover the coach airfare and
 lodging.  How about the first week of October, say on either 10/2 or 10/4,
 or the last week of October, say 10/30?  The arrangement would be that you
 come in on the evening of a Monday or a Wednesday and give a seminar on a
 Tuesday or a Thursday.  Please let me know what works best for
 you.  Thanks.
