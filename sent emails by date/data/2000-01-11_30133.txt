 Frank would like to see the following 3 Locations approved from trading:
 
 First:
 
 Opal; which is already set up as a Location and is out in DRAFT. Dave, I've 
 already asked Frank to have Jeff Shankman look at thh product and offer 
 approval. Please review.
 
 Then:
 
 Location: PGT Malin
 Abbreviation: PGT Malin
 Sort Code: 2850
 Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission 
 Company - Malin.
 
 Location: PG&E Pool
 Abbreviation: PG&E Pool
 Sort Code: 2840
 Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas & Electric 
 Company - City Gate Pool Gas.
 
 Jennifer; can you check with the logistics guys and make sure these are good 
 points and descriptions. Malin Lines 400 and 401 are no longer used, and PGE 
 is City Gate Pool Gas.
 
 
 Frank, if you could review the descriptions also and offer comments I'd 
 appreciate it.
