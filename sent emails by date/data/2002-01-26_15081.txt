 Too bad I didn't talk with you a little earlier.  This sounds like a great job, and ultimately I would be very interested.  However, I'm basically under a 1-year deal now, so I won't be available until Feb '03.
 
 

    
 
 Sean,
      Good luck at UBS.  I have attached the job description I was telling
 you about.  We are also in the market for good marketers, traders and
 structurers.  Keep in touch.
