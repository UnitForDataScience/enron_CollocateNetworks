
 
 Can you look around for the fax of this NDA signed by the Counterparty.  Mark 
 Greenberg will need to initial it and then send it down to Daniel Diamond and 
 he will get an EnronOnline and Enron Net Works officer to sign it.  Once it 
 is signed we will need to fax it to the counterparty.  I will forward Dan's 
 email with the fax and phone number of the counterparty to you.
 
 Thanks!
 

 


  
 
 At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of
 Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval,
 please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713)
 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments
 or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897.
 We look forward to hearing from you.
