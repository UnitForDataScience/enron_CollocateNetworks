 an extra tire in case you get a flat.  I think I loaned Harry my old spare 
 tire.  Anytime Saturday is fine...

 I have a tire pump, but I could take it to Bikesport and have new ones put
 on it and have it checked out.
 
 What do you think?  Could I check it out on Saturday?
 
 

 
  
 
 
 Offer still good.  How goes things with the new beau?  Also, thanks for the
 cooked meats.  They were delicious!

 Morning, Glory,
 
 Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend.
 
 I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still
 good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
 big deal.  Promise!
