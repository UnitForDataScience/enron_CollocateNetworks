 With respect to Ameren, Ron should work directly with me and Lloyd Will.
 
 thanks.
 
  
     
 We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.   Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.
 
 I have instructed Terri to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.
 
 In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).   This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.   We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.
 
 thanks.
