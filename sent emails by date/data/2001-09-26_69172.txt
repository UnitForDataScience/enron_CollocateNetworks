       Phillip ...  hope all is well there in Houston.  We are still
    wondering
       what we ran into at the Carrier Dome.  I thought Lawrence Taylor had
       retired, but apparently he is still playing and wears number 54 for
       Syracuse.
 
       In any event, I have learned that the School of Nursing is having a
    fund
       raising event on Friday, Oct. 12, from late afternoon through the
       evening,
       and Joe Shelnutt will be taking War Eagle to that event.  That of
    course
       means he and  Tiger won't be at the Raptor Center at the time we had
       planned to go out there.
 
       Do you guys want to try it on another trip to Auburn?
