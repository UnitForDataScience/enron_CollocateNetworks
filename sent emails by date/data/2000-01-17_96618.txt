 Shelly Mansfield has drafted the attached Q&A and timeline in anticipation of 
 our lawsuit against TVA regarding our control area.  Please review these 
 materials and let me know if this is the approach we want to take if and when 
 we receive inquiries.  Also attached is a standby statement if we receive 
 inquiries about EPMI's letter to TVA about the MOPA.   We will probably want 
 to revise this statement if the situation escalates.  
 
 Thank you.
