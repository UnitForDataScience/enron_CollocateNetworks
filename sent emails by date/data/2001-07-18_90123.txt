 Bottomline:
 
 Current Vacation Plans
 Fri July 27th - Sun Aug 5th ( 6 Business days)
 Destin, FL.
 Issue: $1,300 Non-refundable Deposit
 
 Proposed Vacation Plans
 Thurs Aug 9th - Mon Aug 13th ( 3 Business days)
 San Antonio, TX
 Proposal: Reimbursement for non-refundable deposit
 
 Question: Given the current activity level and momentum we've achieved, is it worth it to Enron to have me here for 3 more business days?
 
 If you can let me know as soon as possible, I can rearrange my plans with no other incremental costs. My family is OK with this change if appropriate.
 
 Thx
