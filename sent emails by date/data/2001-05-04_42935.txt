 shorter maturity dates though.  I am concerned about long-term yields 
 increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing.  Doesn't it make since to 
 go with shorter maturity dates ri8ght now?
 
 
 
 



 
  
 
 The Muni desk called to say they are seeing a blip in the market and are
 seeing  5 1/4% at par around 2021 to 2025. They think those rates won't
 last.
 
 They called about your portfolio because your ladder is is thin in those
 years.
 
 You have some cash. If you have an interest give me a call. I can fax your
 maturity concentration schedule  to you if you need it. I didn't want to
 send your portfolio info by fax  without your permission.
