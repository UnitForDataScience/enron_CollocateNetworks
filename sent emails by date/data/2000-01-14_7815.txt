 Thanks for the note about the video conference.  I have put that date on my 
 calendar and I am very interested in the discussion.  Any details on where I 
 need to go in Houston to join in?

 Is Sally Beck invited to your videoconference?  Woul dthis be useful for 
 her?  i am interested in understanding more about your comment that "barriers 
 dissolving between settlements, cash, and accounting teams", and I imagine 
 she would be too.
