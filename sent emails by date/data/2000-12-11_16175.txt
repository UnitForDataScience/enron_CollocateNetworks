 a crisis and is on the front-burner of elected officials, the media, business 
 and the public (so if one of our goals was to create a sense of crisis, it's 
 been taken care of).  We need to take advantage of this heightened awareness 
 with an educational campaign.  It's an opportune time to communicate our 
 messages.
 
 Let me know what else you need. 
 Thanks!
