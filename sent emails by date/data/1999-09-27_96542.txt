 I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement. TVA has agreed to these 
 changes.
 TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
 we did not think they met our agreements.
 My  comments to are as follows:
 I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
 submitted. We support this wording.
 In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
 ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence.
 Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one.
 Thanks
 Jim
