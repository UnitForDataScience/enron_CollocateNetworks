 they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a 
 scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and 
 the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply 
 and decrease reliability

 ? The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This 
 will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it 
 with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year 
 contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, 
 this is "locked in to pass."  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on 
 Monday.
  
 ? The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they 
 would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to 
 operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired 
 QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to 
 either operate unprofitably or shut down.
  
 ? The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an 
 involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram 
 Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in 
 Nebraska).  Sokol is described  by sources as "extremely aggressive." 
  
 ? An involuntary bankruptcy filing appears imminent.   Sources believes the 
 trigger event will either be the legislative passage of the plan  tomorrow or 
 the PUC order implementing the plan on Monday.
