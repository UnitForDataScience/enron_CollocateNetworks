
 
 e.g., the ISDA termination payment.  We also reference the 
 claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not "terminating" 
 any "contracts" in that respect.  I assume that we do not want to reference 
 in the letter the claims held by Portland General which "route" through the 
 CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for 
 those.  PG&E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims 
 as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.
 
  I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon.  
 Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit 
 upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not 
 have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day 
 period to expire.  That should reduce another potential challenge to the 
 power contract termination.
 
 Thanks.
