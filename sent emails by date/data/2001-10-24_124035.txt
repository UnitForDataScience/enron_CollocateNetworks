 Thanks,

 I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.
 
 Trust you are well.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Doug
