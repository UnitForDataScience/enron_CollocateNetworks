 Dear Bill:
 
 Thank you very much for volunteering to circulate my resume within Enron. As 
 you know, I am interested in exploring career opportunities in Financial 
 Engineering within Enron. I am particularly interested in joining the 
 research group headed by Dr. Vince Kaminski. 
 
 Enron continues to innovate its way through the energy and telecom 
 marketplace using its substantial intellectual capital. The enclosed resume 
 details my experience, academic background, and contributions in the area of 
 risk modeling and management. Understanding risk is a core competency of 
 Enron and I am excited about the possibility of working, learning, and 
 growing with the very best in the industry.
 
 Please forward my resume within Enron as you see fit. Thank you in advance 
 for any referrals or recommendations you may be able to provide. 
 
 Best regards,
 
 Rabi S. De
