 Dave:
 
 Thanks for your time and patience today.
 
 For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick 
 up the other topics later over beers sometime)
 
 I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term 
 win for those that move swiftly.
 
 Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it.
 
 Shawn
