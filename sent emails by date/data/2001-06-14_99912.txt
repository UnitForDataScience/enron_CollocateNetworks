 Karen Brostad called about this point,  Duke Schultz #1.  It was supposed t=
 o have been reconnected Dec, Jan time frame.  I called Ronnie and he said h=
 e remembers it but we had to assign a new number.  He didn't know what it i=
 s seeing as he's here in Houston.  I tried calling Sammy Williams, he too i=
 s in Houston.  I talked to Danny Garvin he only knew of one Duke connect an=
 d the name did not match up.  I also paged Randy Fitzgerald, he has not ret=
 urned my call.  Karen is having the same problem getting hold of anyone.  I=
  didn't see it on your first and finals either.  Anyway, if you know anythi=
 ng about this call Karen in the AM and let her know.
 
 Thanks,
 verlene
