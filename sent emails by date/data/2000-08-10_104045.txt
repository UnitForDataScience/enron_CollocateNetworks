 We are in the process of updating our legal due diligence for financial 
 trading with Chilean counterparties right now.  Outside counsel is putting 
 together an opinion for us and reviewing our form of master.  We expect to 
 have some information early next week.  I will keep you informed.  In the 
 meantime you should have credit check them out.  Let me know if you have any 
 questions.
