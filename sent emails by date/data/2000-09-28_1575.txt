 or something?
 
 I'm very enthused that I have the skillset to be an advertising critic when I 
 grow up.  It's something I've always wanted to do.
 
 
 PS.  I'm a little sarcastic as well.
 
 


   
 John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were 
 supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, 
 while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the 
 businesses we have created. 
 
 I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving 
 that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would 
 continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add 
 to your emails.  Very masculine!  
 
 Smile, Margaret
 
 ps, i hope you can read my sarcasm over email  you won't 
 hurt my feelings, I promise.  
 
 By the way, by the time I arrived home it was completely dark so I went for a 
 three mile run this morning.  Not fun, but I'm definitely awake right now!  
 BUT, it's all your fault I couldn't go last night....he!he!
 
 Trade well, MSA
