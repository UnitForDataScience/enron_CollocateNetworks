 If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me 
 know.
 
 On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I 
 would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice 
 mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late 
 last week.  The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I 
 described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill & Knowlton who, 
 according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's 
 press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is 
 very well known in CA Democratic circles.  He has been assisting us in 
 certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he 
 has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks 
 to facilitate anything for you in that respect.
 
 I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.  I hope that all is 
 well.
 
 Best regards.
 
 John
