          The options are not valued properly.   The market value is
    calculated
          based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates
    the
          market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0)
    is
          valued OK, but the options are not.
 
          In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet
    in
          the portfolio.
