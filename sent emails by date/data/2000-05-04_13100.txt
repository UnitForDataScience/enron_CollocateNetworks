 Relocation Preferences (Countries)
 
 Global Exposure

 Current International Assignee (Y/N)
 Current Assignment Location 
 Former International Assignee (Y/N)
 Location and Length of Past Assignment(s)
 Reason for Return (As Scheduled, Premature - Change in Business Strategy,

 Jane - is there anything you wish to add or change at this point?
 
 Tim - I will run these by Mike to see what SAP can incorporate in the future 
 (particularly Demographics).
 
 Kathy - Please advise how you envision this process to work; it might be a 
 good idea to discuss the various ways this information could be laid out - 
 thanks!
