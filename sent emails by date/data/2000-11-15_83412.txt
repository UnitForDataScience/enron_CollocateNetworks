 everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, 
 operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd 
 Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool.

 George, Could you please answer a few preliminary operational questions 
 before we proceed..
 Has Scott Neal approved this for our desk (assuming risk and swings)?  Is our 
 logistics group nominating, scheduling, confirming and balancing this 
 wellhead?   Are we buying from you or are we buying from Cabot??? Who's 
 responsible for deal entry and management in Sitara? Who's responsible for 
 notifying us of changes?  Do we need to acquire transport for this or is it 
 moved IT (Transco charges for pool receipts)
 Operationally we need as much lead time to submit timely noms daily and at 
 the first of every month.  We would like changes/swings to be communicated 
 via e-mail, fax if necessary and followed by phone call to ascertain 
 receipt.... 
 Once we have some of these questions answered we can talk details....
 Thanks

 How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas 
 Daily and which group will hold this risk?  
 Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering 
 system?

 Eric & John
 
 Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
 Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
 Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
 a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
 transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
 18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.
 
 Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
 based on the following:
 
 1 year term
 or
 2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000
 
 firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
 70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
 Department
 
 gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
 wellhead volume
 
 Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
 70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
 term
 
 Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
 you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
 pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.
