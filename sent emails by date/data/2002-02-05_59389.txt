 Do you have a list of new curves for UBS.  They will only be taking over history for the curves we will continue to load.

  Zhiyong,
 
 We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.
 
 
 Thanks
 
 Kam
