 Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to 
 finalize and re-submit to Crestar.
 
 TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either 
 add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete 
 them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather 
 than delete completely.
 
 
 This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes 
 and send back to me today. 
 
 Thanks.
 
 OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm 
 and I will add changes that we went through. 
 
 Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... 
 
 PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of 
 their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people.
