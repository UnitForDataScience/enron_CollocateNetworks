  A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email.  
 Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the 
 areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus 
 signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used 
 interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity 
 or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a 
 default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any 
 time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities 
 (default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough 
 default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for 
 fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point 
 of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and 
 Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering 
 Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for 
 regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate 
 guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to 
 be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language.
 

  
  
 
 Kim,
      I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of
 Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If
 we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the
 version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for
 this years volume and price.  What is your preference?
