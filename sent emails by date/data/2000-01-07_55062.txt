 Vince,
 next time this program will be offered in CA in October (see below).
 Let me know what you think,
 
 Tanya.
 
 
 


   
 
 
 Thank you for your message.  Yes, it will be offered in California at
 Stanford, but not until October 15 - 20.  If you look on our website:
 www.gsb.stanford.edu/exed <http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exed>
 (click on programs)
 
 it will give you the information for both programs (London and Stanford).

  Hi, Alicia,
  I work for Enron Research and I would like to take the Executive
 Program on
  Credit Risk.
  I am trying to find out if this program is going to be offered in
 California
  soon. Is the date known?
  Can you, please, let me know.
 
  Appreciate it,
