 additional 18.24%. 
 
 Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 
 chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course 
 the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things 
 getting  better. 
 
 But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six 
 months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the 
 coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the 
 last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  
 If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  
 left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. 
 
 History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  
 day).
