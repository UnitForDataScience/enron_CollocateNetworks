 know if you need a separatecopy of the existing (Global Custody) agreement 
 draft which ENA has negotiated with Chase.  I am hoping to conference in 
 Chase as soon as we can.
 
 Also, Mary mentioned that you should verify with Richard Sage (Enron Credit 
 Ltd. in London) whether ECL is currently negotiating with BONY to put another 
 "Global Custody Agreement" in place.  He may be negotiating an almost 
 identical agreement (not necessary if Enron Corp. is the contracting party or 
 perhaps if ENA ).
