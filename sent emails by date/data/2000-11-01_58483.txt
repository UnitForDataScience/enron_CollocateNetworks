  is  even larger.
 
 We are funding this internally and are starting to develop outside investor  
 support. We have established great partnerships with organizations such as  
 Standard & Poor's and Medley Global Advisors  (http://www.medleyadvisors.com
 ), for ratings and content on the site, VMAC (a  division of FSA that has 
 patented the concept of providing pooled credit  enhancement facilities 
 http://www.fsa.com), for revolving credit enhancement  facilities and 
 Gen3Partners (http://www.gen3partners.com), for strategic and  technological 
 advice. Transactions that cannot be matched can be cleared through  
 Deerhurst, a leading foreign exchange fund manager who has agreed to provide  
 liquidity from day one. We also know that we can purchase insurance for 
 around  $7 billion of annual transactions for just under $1M a year. GCX is 
 now at a  point that it has answered most of the questions that we had. We 
 have a  commitment from Ashton Technologies for full build out of SEC 
 approved  technology in exchange for equity. This technology has been used 
 successfully  for more complex securities transactions and allows for many 
 equity market  facilities that Forex markets do not currently have such as 
 reserve book, limit  order and so forth. A description of the Ashton 
 technology and an executive  summary that we use for our corporate clients 
 are attached. 
 
 We have good corporate support through World Research Advisory (WRA), an  
 affiliated provider of research for corporate treasurers. WRA supplies 
 Gartner  and Forrester type subscription research and advisory services to 
 global 2000  companies. The contact list includes the CFO's of the following 
 companies, many  of whom have agreed to participate in the Global Cash
