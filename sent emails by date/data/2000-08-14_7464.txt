 was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine.  Since this 
 is her last official week with ENA, I did want to do this before she starts 
 her new assignment.

 We have picked Wednesday, Aug 16 for Kristin's luncheon.  Please RSVP to me 
 as soon as possible.  More details will be forthcoming.
