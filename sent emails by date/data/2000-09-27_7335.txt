 reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the 
 need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in 
 writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an 
 efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define 
 and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, 
 then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the 
 context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

   the cover note ?
 
 Fernley  / Sally
 
 Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
 communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
 summary ).
 
 We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
 for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
 Enron Europe newsletter )
 
 Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
 
 Mike
