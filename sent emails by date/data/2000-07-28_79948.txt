 Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told 
 him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - 
 also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested 
 please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy.
