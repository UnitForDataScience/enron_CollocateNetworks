 You probably haven't had time to look at the Duke Energy price.  When you get 
 a chance could you please let me know what the correct price is for May 2000 
 production.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

   
 Elizabeth,
 I have a pricing discrepancy and I was not sure if I send this to you or 
 Oneil.  
 It's for Duke Energy, 5/00 production, deal # 250237.  Duke believes our 
 price is too high.  The system downloaded a price of  $3.95 
 The price should be WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. , which is $2.95 for that month.  ( 
 WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. + 1 ) Duke believes we should have paid them $2.96.
 I think the system pulled in the wrong price.  Could you please let me know 
 if you handle this pricing issue or someone else?
 
 Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
