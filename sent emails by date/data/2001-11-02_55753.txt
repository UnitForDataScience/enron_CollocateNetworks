 Sorry for a short notice but unexpected is part of the
 corporate life. Zimin will cover both my presentation and
 the workshop - he is a very good speaker and I am sure
 he will do a better job that I could do.

 Angelica:
 
 I apologize, but I spoke with Vince and he is unable to get his
 presentation to you as
 requested.  We will have to make copies and mail them.  Please let me
 know where to
 mail them.
 
 He will email you a copy as soon as he can.
 
 Regards,
 
 Shirley Crenshaw
