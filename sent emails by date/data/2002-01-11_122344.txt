 Kevin,
 
 I wanted to provide an update. The conversation went well. I am faxing the " letter " , have offered the CA for financials, and walked Sempra through TW. Upon the review of the letter they will get back with me if there are further questions. Also I offered your participation if needed. With your permission may I have your proxy to sign the letter?
 As an FYI the people on the call were the counterpart of Paul Y and the Chief Credit Officer.
 
 Will keep you posted.
 
 Regards.
