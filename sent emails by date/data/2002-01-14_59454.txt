 Tiffany,
 
 All of the TAGG deals identified by structuring have been moved to that book and we have been calculating and reporting it as of last Thursday.  The sitara book is still being worked on and should be ready to go today.

 Kam,
 
 Could you please provide us with the calculations  and post IDs of the following books using the same criteria that you used for the Bankruptcy book:
 
 	FT US CAN
 	FT Canada
 	FT Ontario (Canadian)
 	FT Intra Ontario
 
 I know that you may not run all these books, but could you help me find the applicable people so that we may obtain the same information that you provided to us on the Bankruptcy book.
