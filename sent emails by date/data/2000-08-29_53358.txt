 I don't think this transaction makes sense. We should not keep increasing our 
 exposure
 in one area, given that we can deploy our capital in a more efficient way 
 elsewhere,
 without taking illiquid, long-term positions.

 Has any of you seen this?  Ideas, comments, feedback?  Thanks for the timely 
 response.  Jeff
