 Could you make a presentation on this topic? It would be a favor to
 our operation in Nebraska and it's not mandatory.

 Hello Margaret.  We are looking for a speaker for a meeting that is being 
 arranged with Nebraska Governor Johanns during the first week in April.
 
 The potential topic is a national perspective on pricing pressures/trends on 
 natural gas, electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production 
 costs, as well as types of risk managment tools that are being used to offset 
 the price fluctuations.
 
 Do you know of anyone, either within the Corporation or outside, who would be 
 available to travel to Omaha to make this presentation?  
 
 I would appreciate any assistance that you could provide, Margaret.
 
 Thanks, 
 
 beth jensen
