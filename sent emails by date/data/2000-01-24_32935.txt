
 
 we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk 
 should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in their 
 p&l?
 CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to 
 discuss?
 
 I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are 
 any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up 
 someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs is 
 working).
 
 Thanks.
