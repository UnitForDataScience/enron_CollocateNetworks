 try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and "appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy.  fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer?  
 
 in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  
 
 eze is (i think) an earls nickname  

             
    Good morning Cooper! 
    I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing 
    to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
    No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in 
    town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone 
    soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
    colder people in my life. 
    Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
    You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
    I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
    part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most 
    of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
    tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
    Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
    Jill
