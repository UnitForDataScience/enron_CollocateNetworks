 Vicki please add some texture if required.

 Kevin Gilligan, CEO of Honeywell's Home and Building Controls called with an interest in either contracts (parts of old GNO) or other operations, including Service Co.
 
 If we have an interest let me know and I will hook you up and get out of the way or assist with your direction.  Gilligan reports to Honeywell CEO Larry Bossidy.
