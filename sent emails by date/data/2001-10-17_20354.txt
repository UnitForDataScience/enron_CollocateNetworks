 This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
 The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.
 
 Hope this helps.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
