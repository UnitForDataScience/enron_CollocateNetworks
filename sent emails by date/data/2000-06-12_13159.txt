 Dear Jane
 
 I have just joined Enron, and will be assisting Tara Rozen and Madeline Fox 
 with their expat work.
 
 We have recently had an enquiry from the UK Inland Revenue regarding Dennis 
 Pick's termination payment.  They have asked that we supply them with a copy 
 of Dennis's original contract of employment (we have the letter of assignment 
 on file, but this is not sufficient for their enquiry). 
 
 Do you know a contact who we could request the contract from?
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Victoria
