 if this is less intimidating for them.  
 
 I  may be able to fly up on Monday am and accomplish what I need to do with 
 BD, although flying on Sunday is fine as well.  TBD.

 I spoke to Fuel Cells and here is my suggested schedule for the negotiations:
 
 October 11, 2000To be determined based on progress of meetings.  If need 
 be, we could continue negotiations in Houston or have Kay patch in by the 
 telephone or do all the negotiations by telephone.  
 
 What are your thoughts?
