 set aside the entire day of Wednesday, March 1 for you to schedule.  We can 
 also be available late Monday afternoon, February 28.  I will advise shortly 
 with respect to local invitees.  Thanks very much.  Sara
 
 
 
 


   
 
 
 
  Sara:  Trucco from Citi just confirmed.  I wondered wheter you would
 be interested in meeting with one of the directors of the CNV who is in
 charge of derivatives issues.  I could try to arrange a meeting if he is in
 BA.  Please confirm.
 
  Who should we invite to the lunch from your local office?
