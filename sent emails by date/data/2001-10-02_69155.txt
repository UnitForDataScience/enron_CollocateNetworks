 I'm looking with the AGG-CREDIT portfolio to determine if the portfolio content is complete/correct.  In doing a comparison between AGG-CREDIT and AGG-PROD-DPR-BU, the following books are shown as active in AGG-PROD but not included in CREDIT.  Any thoughts on whether or not these should be included/excluded?  Based on the book id, I assume they are not intramonth - thus should likely be included.  
 
 ARUBA-SPLY-PRC	US Gas Central		
 OIL-NG-HDG-C-CA-GDL	US GAS Financial		
 
 Separately I heard that there are books labeled as intramonth that include forward positions & vice versa forward books that contain intramonth positions.  Do you have a listing of these?
 
 Thanks
