 Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy 
 Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.  I don't think it makes sense to 
 review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.  Please let 
 me know if the situation changes.

 There are a variety of CAs with U.S. Duke Energy entities.   
 
 Mary J. Heinitz has provided me with a list of these which I'll forward to 
 Mark for his consideration under the cover of a separate email.
 
 Thanks, Edmund.
