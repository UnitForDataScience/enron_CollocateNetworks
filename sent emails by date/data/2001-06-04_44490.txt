  I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a 
 limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form 
 should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company 
 can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in 
 Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.
