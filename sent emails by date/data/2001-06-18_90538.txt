 I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.   Can you
 check into this problem.
 
 I want the view for both portfolios to be:		Open Date
 						Quantity
 						Purchase Price
 						Last Price
 						Cost Basis
 						Market Value
 						Gain/Loss
 						Gain/Loss%
 
 Can you make this the default view setting.
 
 thanks.
