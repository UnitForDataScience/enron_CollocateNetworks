AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not.

 Two quick questions:
 
 1.   The Columbia Gas motion refers to two pooling agreements, the IPP
 Service Agreement and the AS Service     Agreement.  Ms. Shemin's e mail
 attaches a copy of a rate schedule entitled "IPP Rate Schedule
 Interruptible  Paper Pools."   Does this rate schedule also apply to the AP
 Service Agreement, or is there another rate        schedule for that
 agreement?.
 
 2.   Can Mr. McMichael swear the affidavit with respect to the pooling
 agreements, which are with EES, not ENA?
