
 
 Is there an action item with regards to the preparation of agreements? 
 
 If so, I would like Dave Fuller in Portland to work on the creation of the appropriate gas contracts and the discussions with Puget.  
 
 Please advise. BT 
  
     
 Darren, did you check this already.... are there any power MTM positions with Puget Energy that would be in addition to the Gas MTM that you put on my desk. ( $ 50 MM)
 
 Thanks. BT
