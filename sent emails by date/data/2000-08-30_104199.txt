 Does the request apply as well to options to purchase? There is an option in 
 the Catalytica transaction - recently renegotiated ( we are signing the deal 
 up today) to purchase 500,000 plus CCSI shares on a cashless basis. The share 
 number is subject to adjustment in a stock split to occur upon the spin off 
 of CCSI prior to the merger of its parent sometime before year end. The 
 option expires in February 2001.

 If any of the Raptor investments for which you are responsible is comprised, 
 in whole or in part, of warrants, please provide a copy of the warrants (and 
 any related documentation which governs the exercise of the warrants) to 
 either Sara Shackleton or Mary Cook.  For the public companies this should be 
 done ASAP (i.e. no later than the end of business today) and for the privates 
 this should be done by the end of the week.  Also, please arrange to meet 
 with either Mary or Sara to provide a brief explanation as to how the 
 derivatives work (they need to understand the nature of the derivatives in 
 order to properly structure the Raptor hedge).  Once again, I apologize for 
 the short notice but hope that each of you recognizes that the internal 
 pressure to push investments into Raptor has increased exponentially.  Thanks 
 in advance.
