 Odd.... I was here... I will look into any possible phone problems.
 
 Just to be sure: (503)464-8132
 
 If this should ever happen again, please try my cell: (503)708-0867
 
 I am sorry for the inconvenience.... I wasn't avoiding you guys. :)
 
 Thanks!

 Bob (and all),
 
 let's postpone until tomorrow (or next week if you're not available) - no need to force the meeting.
 
 can you do it tomorrow at the normal time?

 Calgary Gang -
 
 I have a doctor's appointment this afternoon, and will be leaving a little early. Can we do this at 12:00 Portland time?
