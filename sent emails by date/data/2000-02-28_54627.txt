 This is a copy of my London presentation. I expect to
 make some minor changes to this presentation for March 13.

  <<REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN THE NEW ECONOMY>>
 
 This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
 go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
 clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
 the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
 welcome any thoughts or comments.
