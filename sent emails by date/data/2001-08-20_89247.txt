Also, "DRAFT" and "For Discussion Purposes Only" should remain on the front page when sent to the customer.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  
 
 
 Thanks
 DP
 
 

    
 
 
 
 Judy -
 
 Received your phone call re GISB Contract with E&A Upstream Company LLC.
 
 Why don't you go ahead and send me your GISB and I will review the same.
 
 I took down your phone number as 713-853-4758 and got someone else's voice mail.  Did I take the number down right?
 
 I look forward to receiving the GISB for review.
 
 Thanks - Jennifer
