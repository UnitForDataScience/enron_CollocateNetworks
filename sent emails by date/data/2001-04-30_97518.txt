  Richard,
 
  Some time ago, you and I recommended to John Nowland, and he agreed, that we 
 didn't have a case against the ship or the supplier of this product ("Elang 
 Crude, fit for export"), but that we would try for a quick settlement with 
 the cargo underwriter.  Attached is a draft of the proposed letter to the 
 cargo underwriters.  David Best, Matt Lee, and I have reviewed and approved 
 it and recommend it to you.  The red-lining will of course be cleaned up.  It 
 will either be signed by Jim Studdert of our insurance group, or sent by him 
 with a transmittal letter signed by him.
 
  Please let me know whether the letter is acceptable to you.  Thanks.
 
  Britt
