 SACRAMENTO  in a regulated system
 receiving power at stable prices from the generators and contracts retained
 by the utilities. 
 
 
 Businesses and other large users, the "non-core" customers, would be free to
 shop around for low-cost power by 2003 if they agreed to help pay off the
 Edison debt. 
 
 
 The Edison rate increase for large users would be limited to 50 percent. The
 PUC would create a "balancing account" to track costs, issuing a refund if
 too much was collected or raising rates if revenue fell short. 
 
 
 Business and generator groups told Hertzberg last week that they reached
 agreement on a general framework, with the exception of the state purchase
 of the Edison transmission system and some other issues. But the consumer
 and labor representatives opposed the framework. 
 
 
 Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network said in a dissenting statement
 that an across-the-board allocation of state power costs would be "clearly
 unfair" and cause residential users to subsidize direct-access customers. 
 
 
 Hertzberg said he is considering some of the ideas in the framework
 presented by the Isenberg group and may make a proposal in a week or two. 
 
 
 "We are looking at all the possibilities," Hertzberg said. "We are trying to
 do some form of direct access within the current contract structure."
