 Villages suffer with Enron shutting shop
 
 Enron is going back, and going back with it are the riches it brought to Gu=
 hagar and Dabhol talukas. Most hit are traders at Shringartali (Tali), a ma=
 rket that is 10 km away from Veldoor, where Enron built its 2000 plus mw th=
 ermal power plant. The crash here has been more severe than the dotcom cras=
 h as business volumes have reduced by more than 1000 per cent and the real-=
 estate market has hit rock bottom.Says Uday Deolekar, who owns a building m=
 aterial shop at Tali, "It used to be Diwali time while the project was on. =
 On Sundays, the four-lane road would throb with buyers." The party was over=
 , however, with the state Government pulling the plug on Enron. Gloom took =
 over as workers started leaving the project site around February. There has=
  been little business activity since then.Deolekar used to run a small shop=
  of pan-beedi and groceries till about eight years ago when Enron came to D=
 abhol. Construction activity picked up in the area and Deolekar, with his b=
 rother-in-law Mohan Sansare, seized the opportunity and started supplying b=
 uilding material. Business flourished and the Sansares took over a plot of =
 land to open four more shops. Sitting at one of them, Deolekar is waiting f=
 or customers today."Villagers in Tali and nearby areas wanted to refurbish =
 their houses to accommodate paying guests coming in hordes. There was great=
  demand for accommodation and hardly any supply. While blue-collar workers =
 were happy with dormitory-type arrangements, white-collar officials wanted =
 one-room, kitchen, attached bath type apartments. Many villagers started co=
 nstructing lodges and boarding houses to cater to demand. Little did they r=
 ealise that the party would have come to an end in any case once the constr=
 uction was over," says Deolekar.
 
 However, his brother-in-law Mohan is happy that Enron is going back. "They =
 were quite arrogant. They may have brought money to this area, but they als=
 o brought all the vices - booze, gambling and what not. Enron will go back,=
  cash flow will dry up but these vices will now remain with us forever," he=
  says. He wants an Indian company to take over the plant and run it. Naseem=
 shet, owner of Kasam Mohammed Memon shop, is one of the biggest traders in =
 Tali. "I used to work for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). When Enron offi=
 cers came here in 1994, they stayed in my guesthouses. I was pressurised by=
  the party then to break off my ties with them, but I told myself I must ke=
 ep politics out of business. I am happy I did that. See how BJP leaders are=
  now backing the project to the hilt. I received bulk orders and business s=
 hot up. Last three years were crazy. Now we are back to square one - cateri=
 ng to around 6,000 buyers from nearby villages," he says.
 
 The Memons rented out an entire building, accommodating around nine persons=
  for Rs 21,000 a month during boom time. Now the building does not have any=
  takers even for Rs 3,000 per month. The Memons had also started a transpor=
 t business seeing the vast money involved. Dabhol Power Company (DPC) used =
 to pay Rs 45,000 per month to hire a Tata Sumo. "Our drivers started their =
 own business. After the crash, they have come back to us begging for Rs 2,5=
 00-a-month job. But now I can't afford them," he says. Nandu Bartakke, who =
 owns a grocery shop in Guhagar, recalls how Rs 10 per kg rice would be term=
 ed as "expensive" by locals. "After they got jobs at DPC, however, their li=
 festyles changed. They wanted Surti Kolam rice, which costs Rs 24 per kg. I=
 f I said it was costly, they would tell me they couldn't digest the Rs 10 p=
 er kg rice. They forgot that they grew on that rice," he says. Most of thes=
 e locals, who had suddenly become rich with their Rs 10,000-a-month jobs wi=
 th DPC, are yet to get over the crash. Bartakke claims traders from Chiplun=
  market, which is 35 km away from DPC site, reaped rich dividends. "They kn=
 ew what an industry requires. They have been catering to MIDC's industrial =
 estate at Lote Parshuram for years now. They carefully invested their money=
  and focussed on what DPC needed. Hardly any of them ever indulged in tempo=
 rary markets such as real estate or transport," he says.Agrees Shailesh War=
 watkar, a shop-owner in Chiplun market. "We concentrated on chillar items s=
 uch as plastic bags, ball pens and stuff like that. It was astonishing to s=
 ee DPC paying Rs 5.25 for used gunny bag, otherwise priced at 60 paise in t=
 he market. DPC always wanted huge quantities in real quick time, and they p=
 aid any price that was quoted."=20
 
 Not all have made money though. For Hari Babu of S N Instrumentation, the e=
 xperience has come as a shocker. His company was awarded a sub-contract by =
 Punj-Lloyd. Babu came in February and by April, DPC was sailing in troubled=
  waters. Since mid-June Babu has hardly had any work. He has sent back 78 p=
 eople from his team and is awaiting further instructions from his company's=
  office in Kolkata. "We will sue them. How can they a terminate six months'=
  contract just like that?" says a livid Babu. But he knows the futility of =
 his anger. "We will sue Punj-Lloyd. Punj-Lloyd will slap case against Sansc=
 ra, the French company. Sanscra will start legal proceedings against Bechte=
 l. Bechtel will file suit against DPC and DPC will go in arbitration agains=
 t Maharashtra Government. It's a long and never-ending chain."=20
 
 DPC auctioning jeeps, computers at throwaway prices=20
 
 Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and several other companies who were involved in=
  the setting up of Dabhol Power Project, have started auctioning four-wheel=
 ers, computers and are likely to put on sale refrigerators and air-conditio=
 ners.The buzz in the area is vehicles like Tata Sumos, Mahindra Armada, Com=
 mander and Jeeps are available at throwaway prices. "They are selling vehic=
 les kilo ke hisaab se. I heard a jeep was available for just Rs 27,000," sa=
 id Warwatkar. Indeed, there were a few vehicles put on sale at the site car=
 rying a price tag of Rs 29,000 for 1997 Commanders. But the tag also mentio=
 ned of major breakdown of engine as known defects. Most other vehicles were=
  available at a minimum bid price of Rs 60,000 onwards and looked in bad sh=
 ape after a rough use in difficult terrain. Bodywork was required in most c=
 ases. Locals, however, believe it's still a good buy.
 
 The goods are, however, are offered to employees first, who bid their price=
 . Some of them have started selling these goods at higher prices to others.=
  Naseem Memon bought a Mahindra Marshall for Rs 1.11 lakh through one of th=
 e employees who had bought it at company auction, and immediately got an of=
 fer of Rs 1.25 lakh. Memon is not selling it just now. "I will repair it an=
 d I am sure it will fetch at least Rs 1.75 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.," he says. Th=
 e area is flooded with buyers from Mumbai, Karad, Satara and Pune. Shortly,=
  computers, fridges and ACs will also be put on sale and DPC employees will=
  have their hands full with requests from outsiders.
