 Keegan,
 
 Samantha's hard drive crashed today, I'm having hardware look at it, but you might want to speak with Janette about ordering Samantha a new machine, she has an older compaq desktop that has had several major hardware failures over the last 6 months. Hardware can replace the hard drive but in order to save in time and productivity, a new machine might need to be considered. Let me know.
