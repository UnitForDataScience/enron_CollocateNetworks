 =20
 contracts may only be executed by an officer at the Vice President level or=
 =20
 above.  I checked the Corporate Secretary's Records and they indicate that=
 =20
 neither Beth Perlman nor Richard Burchfield meet such requirements for Enro=
 n=20
 Net Works.  Mark Greenberg directed me to get the agreement executed by=20
 Phillippe Bibi.  Other officers we frequently get Networks agreements=20
 executed by are David Berberian, Managing Director, Greg Piper, Managing=20
 Director and Chief Operating Officer, Rex Shelby, Managing Director, or And=
 y=20
 Zipper, Vice President.  If it relates to Commodity Logic, we can go to Tom=
 =20
 Gros, Vice President.  Feel free to approach any of this slate of officers =
 to=20
 get your documents executed.

 Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor

 Thank you.
