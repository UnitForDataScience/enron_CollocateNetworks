 As you may be aware, there has been an ongoing proceeding at the CPUC  
 regarding short-run avoided cost (SRAC) payments made by SCE, and the other  
 utilities to QFs.? The avoided cost posting is based on a Transition  Formula 
 adopted in D.96-12-028 that incorporates various border price  indices.? On 
 July 28, 2000, SCE filed a petition to modify D.96-12-028 to  revise its 
 Transition Formula, claiming that the existing procedure resulted in  too 
 high a price.
 ?
 The draft?decision issued by Commissioner Wood adopts a formula, to be  
 updated monthly, to revise SCE's factor adopted in D.96-12-028 and adopts an  
 alternative gas index to replace the Topock index adopted in D.96-12-028.?  
 ?
 However, you may be particularly interested to see that the draft decision  
 also establishes a ceiling price for payments to QFs of $67.45/MWh, based on 
 the  reasonableness standard described by the FERC in its 12/15 order.
