 Phillip Allen and Keith Holst indicated that the curve changes in question 
 for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.  Let me know if you have 
 any further questions.

   What factors account for the entire curve changing so 
 dramatically from last month to this month?
 
 
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Jennifer
