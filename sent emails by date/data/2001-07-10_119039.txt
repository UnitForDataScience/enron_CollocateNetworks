If it comes to you from me, Leslie Hansen or Mark Greenberg, you can assume that Legal has signed off and it is just coming to you for final approval.  Let us know if you no longer want to receive these.
 
  
     
 Dave:
 
 I am back in the office from maternity leave.  PPL Montana is finally ready to use EOL and would like to finalize the attached letter, which I sent to them last winter.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
 
 Best,
 
 Leslie
