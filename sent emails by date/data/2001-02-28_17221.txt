 flying a plane to pick up Cameron and Rory in Carmel.  Have you guys spoken 
 in the last few months!?!?!?  (kidding.)  And don't worry about my 
 birthday 
     
 
 
 
 Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows 
 about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers, 
 Kistler, etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number 
 is (707) 829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but 
 you can "double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the 
 winemaker at Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric 
 on some projects.
