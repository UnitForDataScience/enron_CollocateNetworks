
 
 P.s., thanks for the offer on the duck lease I have my personal duck lease down here that we can also make 
 available.  There are overnight quarters if we need them.  (Last year we took 
 over 600 ducks off the properties).

 Drew - Depends if they can recognize the difference between a Lab and a Hun.  
  We just received the renewal notice for 2000/01.  I recommended to Dave N. 
 that we renew the membership.
  I will ask Rosemary to give both of you notice when she gets the approval 
 from Dave.
  Once approved we would be happy to help set up outings.  
 
 Thanks.  John
