 should be almost done, and I'd love to show it to you, too.  I'm pretty open 
 also, but am doing super saturday again, and am not sure what my deal is 
 friday evening (if anything, and will know by tomorrow).  
 
 Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity 
 balls, social scene, etc.  So I had a Palm Beach Partyvery tame.

 ok...so I do want the low-down on last night b/c I am sure there is a lot 
 that is inappropriate for email!  I will be out of the office all afternoon 
 so if you want to talk I'll be on my cell phone 256-5582.
 Big....small....it is still the Enron Executive Committee and you should feel 
 extremely proud.  I am so happy for you!
 I hope that you have a great lunch and that your speech went will this 
 morning.

 Great!  Sorry YOU weren't there...
 I'm on my way out  for a lunch.  I'll call you later.   (I'm excited about 
 the exec committee, but it is a little big, so I told Skilling we should 
 rename it the exec villiage!)
