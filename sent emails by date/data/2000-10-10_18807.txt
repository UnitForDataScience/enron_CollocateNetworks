 Cynthia - Here is a map from the hotel to the office.
 
 From street level, Commissioner McIntyre will need to take the escalator at 
 Three (3) World Trade Center up to the main entrance.
 
 Inside the double doors is a guard desk.  He needs to sign in and get a Guest 
 pass.  
 They will ask him who he is here to see and he should advise Lysa Akin and 
 give them my extension at 7927.
 
 I will then come down and escort him to the floor.
