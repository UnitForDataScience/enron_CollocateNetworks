 USA: Senators renew high-speed Internet tax credit bill.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A bill that would encourage businesses to 
 bring high-speed Internet access to underserved areas was reintroduced in the 
 Senate on Tuesday, with the hopes that President Bush would include the item 
 in his budget.
 Computers equipped with a "broadband" or high-speed Internet connection can 
 download information at a rate of up to 1.5 megabits per second, or about 25 
 times faster than a standard, dial-up connection. While broadband access is 
 currently available in many business districts and affluent residential 
 neighborhoods, the service has not yet spread to less affluent or more 
 sparsely populated areas. 
 The bill would provide a five-year, 10 percent tax credit to Internet 
 companies that extend broadband service to rural or underserved urban areas.
 Companies who build "next generation" networks, with download speeds of up to 
 22 megabits per second, would receive a 20 percent, five-year credit.
 The bill was introduced by Republican senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and 
 Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Democrats Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and John 
 Kerry of Massachusetts. It was co-sponsored by 32 other senators.
 The 36 senators sent a letter to President Bush urging him to include the 
 bill in his initial budget proposal.
 The bill attracted the support of 59 senators and 115 House members last 
 year, the letter claimed.
