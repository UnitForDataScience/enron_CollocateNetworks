 of you before my  Father."
 
 Not ashamed Pass this on . . . only if you mean it.
 
 Yes, I do Love God.
 
  He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
 functioning each and everyday. Without Him, I would be nothing. Without him, 
 I am nothing, but with Him I can do all things, through Christ that 
 strengthens me.  Phil 4:13
 
 If you Love God, and are not ashamed of all the marvelous
 things he has done for you. Send this to ten people and the person who sent 
 it to you!
