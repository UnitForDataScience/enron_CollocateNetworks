 business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the 
 effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all 
 believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and 
 rewarded.
 
 Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) 
 customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions 
 and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.
 
 I look forward to sitting down to discuss.
 
 Regards
 Delainey
 
 
   
 Could you please send an e-mail to Delainey, Lavorato, and Calger summarizing 
 our long term deals done this year.  It should be pretty short with just the 
 facts.  The deals I can think of are Kaiser, Roseville, Santa Clara, Redding, 
 and Merced.  They didn't ask for it, but I think it would be nice to do a 
 quick, short, sweet piece of Portland Orig/Middle Market PR.  Let me know 
 your thoughts.
