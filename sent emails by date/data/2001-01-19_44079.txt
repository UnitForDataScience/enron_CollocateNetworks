  I have reviewed the attached contract and it gives me a lot of concern.  
 First brush, it is one sided in their favor and offers us no breakage 
 protection.  Specifically, 
  Section 4.4

 Janet,
 
 Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
 Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
 not submit a bid.
 
 If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
 generate an original contract.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
