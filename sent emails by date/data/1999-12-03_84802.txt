   Interconnect
 
 I have run some additional flow studies for the east side of town to 
 determine HPL's ability to deliver gas to MidCon Texas at the proposed 
 Flagstaff interconnect.  With gas leaving Bammel at a reduced pressure of 600 
 psig, HPL will only be able to deliver 74 MMCFD at around 450 psig to MidCon 
 Texas, assuming the combined Equistar/Destec Channelview delivery is only 60 
 MMCFD.  Increasing the Bammel pressure to 650 psig will only increase the 
 deliverability to 78 MMCFD.  Therefore, it would be safe to say that with 
 pressures at Bammel ranging between 600-650 psig, HPL will only be able to 
 deliver around 75 MMCFD to MidCon Texas.  One of the main reasons why the 
 deliverability to MidCon Texas only increases by 4 MMCFD with a 50 psig 
 increase in Bammel pressure is that the increased pressure backs off gas to 
 Channelview from the 12" Baytown line.  With that gas backed off, more gas 
 must be supplied from the Bammel direction, using up a portion of the 
 additional capacity generated by the increase of 50 psig at Bammel.  Making 
 the initial assumption that no gas will flow to Channelview from the 12" 
 (3018) line will only further deteriorate HPL's ability to deliver gas to 
 MidCon Texas.
