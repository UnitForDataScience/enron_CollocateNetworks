 I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration?
 I went to New Orleans last weekend.
 It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!
 I did fall in "LOVE" Friday night but I think it was one of those one day viruses?
 It was a nice feeling!
 
 Are we still on for Wednesday night?
 It still works for me!
 
 I hope all is well!
