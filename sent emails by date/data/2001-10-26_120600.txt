 I don't mind working for a few more years.. just don't want it to be 20 more.
 
 I don't think I will be in Denver that early.... What's going on?
 
 Calgary, Who knows????? 
 
 Stock meltdown is a long story... perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment.. we are in preservation mode right now.... but I believe things will be fine. All in all we have had the best year ever, the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest...time will tell who is correct.
 
 Better run, let's talk soon.
