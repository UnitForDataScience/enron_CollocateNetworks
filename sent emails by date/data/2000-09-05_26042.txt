 be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.  Additionally, it looks 
 like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the 
 16th.  This should be -0- also.  By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis 
 (Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter 
 balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.

 Karen/Sherlyn,
 
 Gary has placed this in Daren's lap.  Please read the below information that 
 was requested of me from Daren. 
 
 This is the latest.
 
 I'll get back as soon as I hear from Daren again about my response to him.

 Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   
 
 20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
 day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
 10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
 invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
 report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
 not valid for the deal?
 
 When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
 that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  
 
 Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
 to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
 added to the deal.
