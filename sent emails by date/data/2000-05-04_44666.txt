
 
 Nancy,
 
 Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is 
 for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one 
 you are making.
 
 The directions to my house are as follows:
 
 1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
 2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
 3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray 
 apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is 
 "Ashby", make a right on Ashby.
 4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 
 1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the 
 back yard.
 
 My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look 
 forward to seeing you there!
