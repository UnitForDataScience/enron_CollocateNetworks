 Hi Worm,
 
 How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!
 What are the dates you are going to Alaska?
 Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?
 Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!
 I have two offers on the table right now.
 Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one
 I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,
 I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.
 How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?
 Let me know.
 Love,
 Jul
