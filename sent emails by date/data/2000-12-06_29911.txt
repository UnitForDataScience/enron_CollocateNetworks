 Rob - I just received your message about the loan extensions and Central
 Bank registrations. I have been working with Celso Bernardi, Rafael Rangel
 and Rick Hopkinson of Enron and Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of Machado
 Meyer on this. Also, I am preparing sort of a "critical path" items
 checklist on the sub-debt that John Barquin and I are going to discuss with
 John Novak tomorrow at 9 a.m. After we work through it, I would be glad to
 forward it to you.
 
 In short and in answer to your specific question, as advised by Machado
 Meyer, I think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all
 of the sub-debt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements
 between EPE and GasMat (as Borrowers) and then the respective Enron and
 Shell lenders to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2001 as the note
 from Celso below explains. Then we will just deliver request for extension
 letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to
 reflect the new maturity date. This should all be done before the existing
 loans mature on December 31, 2000.
 
 Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep
 you apprised of any developments. Regards, Melissa
