 I have left a message with John that I have received approval from Dave to 
 give them a bilateral termination right.  I will send them the language 
 shortly.

 John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue 
 contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate 
 contract.  
 Will you please call John (704-382-4061) regardng this question?
 
 Thanks, Carol, and have a wonderful weekend.
