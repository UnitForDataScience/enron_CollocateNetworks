 The Project Chronology document indicates letters or correspondence I am 
 trying to track down from EECC.  I would appreciate your comments on the 
 letter I plan to send to SW in repsonse to the December 8th fax and any 
 updates to the chronolgy that appear to be incorrect or lacking.
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks, Ron.
