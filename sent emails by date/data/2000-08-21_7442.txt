 and Dad seemed to like that alternative.  And in June, I think that the 
 mountains sound great.  I have a preference for Western mountains something like that would also offer our
 little and not-so-little ones something to do.  I've been searching the web
 for places during lunch.  Will compile some info and let you know...
