 agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.
 
 Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man?
 
 
 
 
 
 


   
 
 My last response didn't make sense... now that I re-read it. I meant to see
 I like a cat personality better.
 
 I'm sorry about the cushy remark... I'm guessing you have worked out a
 lot... since I last saw you. It's probably rock hard now.
 
 So how is ingrid??
 
 
 
 

 
  
 
 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
 That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine
 is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!
 
 What's up with you girl?

 See.... I'm being nice and not asking any other questions.
 
 Hope you're doing okay.
