
 
 Jim,
 
 I can send you copies of the  reprints of some papers I wrote
 or co-authored. Please, let me know how many copies do you need.
 
 I shall prepare power point presentations for the student meeting
 and for the faculty meeting.
 
 For the students: review of my group (things we work on) with an intention
 of generating some interest among the students and soliciting resumes.
 
 For the faculty meeting: challenges that energy markets pose to financial 
 modeling.
 I shall be able to E-mail the Power Point presentations later this month.
 
 Vince
 
 
 
 
 


   
 
 
 Dear Vince,
 
 Would you mind emailing to me a short biography/vita sometime when you get
 a chance?  Also, if you have a paper to circulate or any PowerPoint slides
 that you'll want to use either in your presentations to my students
 Thursday afternoon, 2/3, or to the faculty seminar on Friday morning, 2/4,
 please email these to me.  This would be greatly appreciated.
 
 My colleagues and I are looking forward to your visit on Feb. 3-4 to LSU.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jim Garven
