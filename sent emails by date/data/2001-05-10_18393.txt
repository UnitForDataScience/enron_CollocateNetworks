 e=20
 (surprise).
  for some employers, could mean cutting into
 their workforce, or leaving the area all together,=018 said Dr. James Woody=
 ,
 President of Roche Pharmaceuticals R&D in Palo Alto and Chairman of the
 Board of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group.  =01&We want to do our fai=
 r
 share in paying for rate increases, but the disproportionate nature of this
 proposal could be devastating to employers. We need a rate structure that
 will allow employers to thrive and help pull us out of this economic
 downturn.=018
 
 The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group understands and acknowledges the nee=
 d
 to raise electric rates to help minimize blackouts, which will protect the
 public=01,s health and safety.  However, to achieve desired conservation an=
 d
 fairness, it is essential that all Californians share proportionally in rat=
 e
 adjustments.
 
 =01&Proportional rate increases should be implemented with no rate shifting
 between classes of energy users.  Member companies of SVMG are committed to
 being part of the solution, as we work together to conserve power, retain
 our workforce and ensure a healthy economy,=018 said Guardino.
 
 =01&Apparently, the PUC is out of touch with working families, conservation=
  or
 jobs in California,=018 said Guardino.  =01&It=01,s a naive proposal.  It a=
 ssumes we
 can put a firewall between working families and jobs their employers
 provide; but instead this notion threatens the livelihoods of California
 workers and businesses.=018
