 572069
 West Services buys from APX
 NP-15


 TOTAL MWH = 480
 
 576468
 West Services buys from APX
 NP-15

 TOTAL MWH = 96
 
 Please let me know if this is correct. (I hope!) And don't hesitate to call 
 me with questions or other deal corrections. I will be running between two 
 different desks today, so if you can't reach me at my regular extension 
 (503-464-7486), I can be reached at 503-464-3823.
 
 Thanks,

 Kate:
 
 Can you please modify that deal that you made the price $140 yesterday to 
 make it for the 6th only?  The 7th is all at $150.
 
 Thanks

 Chris,
 One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 

 per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
 lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
 week.  Have a good weekend.
