 Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
 might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
 recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
 promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
 Many thanks for your help.
 
 Michael
