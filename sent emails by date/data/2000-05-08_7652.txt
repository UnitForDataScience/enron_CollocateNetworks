 HI, Sal.  Well, I guess Meagan told you that I went ahead and called her
 since I was headed up to James Avery - and realized time is running out!
 I think I found the earrings she wants, but I wanted to make sure.  They are
 really TINY gold studs, in the shape of very gold hearts.   Does that sound
 right?  (She said she has silver ones just like them but wants gold.)   If
 those are the ones, I'll have those sent to her.
 
 Hope you had a good weekend.  We had a social one - friends over for drinks
 on Friday (we have christened the bucket, by the way!); dinner party on
 Saturday; babtism/brunch on Sunday . . . I pulled up Enron's web site the
 other day and printed out an article about the company just for fun -
 thought I should learn more about it.   Interesting stuff.    Love, C.
