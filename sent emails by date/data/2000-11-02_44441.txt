 Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
 to read:
 
 "(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
 obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
 enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
 Antonio which govern payments by Customer."
 
 There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...
