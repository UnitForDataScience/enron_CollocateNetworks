 Here's a word version of the MSA.  Sorry for the delay.  Could you make 
 changes in strike-out-underline format and email back to me when you're 
 done?  Thanks a million.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Cynthia,
 
 I have come by your office several times and continue to miss you. So, I have 
 to result to the "dreaded e-mail" :) Could you send me the latest version of 
 the Master P&S Agreement?  Many thanks.
 
 Regards,
 
 Donald
 
 PS: When you get a minute, give me a call so that we can chat.
