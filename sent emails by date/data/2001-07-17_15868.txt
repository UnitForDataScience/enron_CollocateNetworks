 Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today 
 and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again 
 tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a 
 chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose 
 unless significantly amended.
 The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" 
 hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be 
 heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to 
 support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the 
 best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problemssupport the bill (though we are supporting 
 it behind the scenes).
 
 What people don't know:
 Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by 
 Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his 
 signature. 
 Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the 
 Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not 
 postpone).
 Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature 
 will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to 
 postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on 
 the energy legislation at the same time.
 
 Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not 
 get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.
 
 Best,

 Sacramento is one goofy place.
