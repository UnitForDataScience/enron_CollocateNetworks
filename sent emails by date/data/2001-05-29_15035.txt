 Hey Bruce,
 
 Thanks for the response.  I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid.  I sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well.  It would be nice to know where we are at.  If you could provide me a rough number, that would be helpful.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Sean
 
  

 
  
 
 Hey Bruce,
 
    Hope you had a good vacation.  I was just touching base to see where
    we're at.  I leave for Europe on June 5 and I'll be gone until July 2.
    My last day in the office here will be either Thursday or Friday of this
    week.  Some other places you can contact me are:
 
    cell:  503-805-2557
    home:  503-656-5253

 
    Thanks,
 
    Sean
