
 
 Terry,
 
 Please set aside 30 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to Su=
 zette.   I don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be a=
 ppreciated.   Please coordinate with TJ Black (3-5800).
 
  
     
 Terry Donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence.=
   Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefit=
 s of joining this effort?
 
 The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the=
  EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management proce=
 ss from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the se=
 nior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findi=
 ngs.
 
 This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be a=
 ppreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help. =20
 
 
 Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is le=
 aning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking =
 for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (a=
 nd also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to=
  get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.
 
 Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring an=
 d was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of=
  weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that=
  by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walkin=
 g away from his commitment to structuring.  By the time he left he was almo=
 st ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more.  He is definite=
 ly someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.
