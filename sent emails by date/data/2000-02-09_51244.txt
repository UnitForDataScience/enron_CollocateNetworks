 Thanks again for taking the time to visit.? Both faculty and students got a 
 lot out of your presentations.
 
 I have a favor to ask concerning the expense reimbursement process.? Can you 
 mail all travel and lodging receipts to my secretary Joan Payne at the 
 following address:
 
 Joan Payne

 Thanks,
