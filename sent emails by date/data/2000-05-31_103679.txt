 worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature 
 here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol 
 isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a 
 non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little 
 written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is 
 because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this 
 master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?  Sara

 Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and
 no
 one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1)
 replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a
 broader
 range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA
 definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though
 the
 master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at
 713
 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  Thank you for
 your
 help.  Sara
