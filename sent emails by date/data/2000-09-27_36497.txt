 Kevin,
 
 Doing some more month end clean up.  
 
 I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is:
 
 For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 
 through July 31,200 for 1Bcf.
 
 1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000
 
 I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into 
 this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski.
 
 If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice.
 
 Thanks,
 Kevin
