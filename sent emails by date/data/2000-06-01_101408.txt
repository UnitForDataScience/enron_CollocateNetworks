
 
 Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no 
 reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those 
 months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would 
 work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I 
 recall correctly.
 
 Also 
 See previous comment as well.  Need to make sure we want to commit to a 10 
 year discount, as policy may change and Tw would be required to absord the 
 difference.  MK
