 >                    Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc
 (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth
 per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to
 The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I
 prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

 >                    This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at
 Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion
 was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying
 any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson
 Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.

 >                    Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken
 with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in
 the past.  He will fax a letter to me.
