 In review of our third quarter file, we have not received the P&L top pages 
 or curve shift reports for the following regions:  West Firm, FT Northwest 
 and Mgmt. West.  Please provide this information as we would like to close 
 out our third quarter file.  Thank you in addition for your help.
 
 Sharon
