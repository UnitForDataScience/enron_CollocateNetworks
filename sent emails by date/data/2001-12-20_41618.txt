 Do you know if this agreement has been signed and, if so, who would have the original or a copy?
 
 Thanks!

 Paul,
 
 I've heard a rumour that there's a Global Netting Agreement for Duke.  Is there any way you can find this out?  They owe us, the gas guys and the continental guys money, but we apparently owe them loads in the states.
 
 Neil.
