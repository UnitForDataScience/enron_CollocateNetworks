I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.  Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.  I really want to try and get together while I'm there.  I may be going elsewhere the 6th thru the 9th (my friend, Emily, wants to take a little trip somewhere) but I will definitely be in town Saturday night through Monday...let me know.
 
 I was very excited to hear about Caycie too.

 The 380 is the total price so that would be divided.  You are about a 5
 mintue walk from Westminister.

 I am looking for a female to share a 2 bedroom flat in Central London.  The
 rent is
 
 
 
 ?380 per week total.  It is an extremely nice 2nd story gated flat
 which gets great sun and is located just to the side of the National
 Gallery.
 
 You have your choice of Leicester Square, Charing Cross, Embankment, or
 Piccadilly Tube stops.  Each is within 1/4 mile of the flat.  It is a 15
 minute bus ride to the City which includes time spent waiting for the bus!
 
 I am looking for someone to move in August or September and stay at least
 through the end of June.
 
 If you have any questions please call Ashley at 0788-418-5453 (mobile).
 Please forward this to anyone you feel might be interested.
 
 Thank you,
 Ashley Marynick
