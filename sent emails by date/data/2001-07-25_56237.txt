 GUIDE TO INVESTORS:  COMPANY-LEVEL
 
 STOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM
 
 The following factors will help companies weather the storm, from most to least
 importance:
 
 Trading and risk management skills.  A strong trading desk acts as the "eyes
 and ears" to the market, often providing advance warning of changes in the
 commodity price outlook.  Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a
 strong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their
 competitors.  The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits
 from trading and risk management activities, own little if any generating
 capacity, and are characterized by a commodity price-neutral earnings model.
 All of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help
 their overall activity.  Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron
 (ENE-1H).  We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price
 environment.  Other companies with strong trading/risk management operations
 include Dynegy (DYN-1H) and Aquila (ILA-1H).  Duke Energy (DUK-1H) and Mirant
 (MIR-1H) also have strong operations.  In terms of vulnerability to power
 prices, we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions, owing to the lack or
 near-lack of generating capacity owned.
 
 Contracting/hedging activity.  The more aggressive a company's moves were to
 lock in power prices earlier this year, the better positioned they are.
 Nevertheless, the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on
 earnings, particularly in the long-run.  We note that Calpine (CPN-2H), which
 we have downgraded to 2H from 1H, has aggressively stepped up its hedging
 activity in recent weeks, signing a 3,000 MW deal with Shell, a 1,000 MW deal
 with Reliant Resources (RRI-NR).  This activity appears to coincide with the
 rapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months.
 
 Offsetting "short" positions.  This is a characteristic typical of electric
 utilities, who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the
 short obligation to sell power to their customers.  Utilities that are well-
 positioned in this regard include:  EXC and AEP.  Utilities that are most
 vulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an
 effort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play
 Power Producers.  These include:  AYE, CEG, and PPL.  We are particularly
 concerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity, or,
 separately, relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars
 to upgrade.  These plants are often the "marginal" unit, providing earnings in
 tight pricing environments, but having significantly less value as prices
 decline.
 
 Backlog of plant development.  We also think that companies with significant
 plant development backlogs can "muscle" their way through a weakened commodity
 price environment.  In particular, we note CPN, whose plants in operation grow
 as follows:
 
 Figure 4. Calpine Earnings Metrics, 2000-2003E
 
                          2000     2001     2002     2003       CAGR
 Y/E MW in operation     5,883   11,705   21,266   30,463        73%
 % of portfolio hedged             85%      71%      61%
 EPS                     $1.11    $1.95    $2.30    $3.00        39%
 
 They have hedged aggressively their output from their plants, so even though
 future plants have lower margins, overall EPS growth can still be impressive.
 Nevertheless, we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN, reflecting the
 impact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output.  Our revised
 "Outperform" rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth
 over the 2000-2003 period.
 
 SUMMARY OF RATINGS/ESTIMATES/PRICE TARGET CHANGES
 
 REVISED VALUATION TABLE
 
 RISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE
 
 We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance.
 
 Some horses are already out of the barn.  Power Producers and selected
 Energy Merchants (those with exposure to power prices) are down 26% since
 peaking on May 1.  Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now
 reflected in the stocks.  However, we do not think all of the horses are out of
 the barn, and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at
 this time.  The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS
 estimates.  We think this is likely, particularly for 2002 and 2003, if power
 prices continue their decline.  We think when this happens, stocks are likely
 to go down further.
 
 Hotter Weather.  So far in 2001, weather across the country has been near-
 normal vs. hotter-than-normal weather last year.  The year-on-year moderation
 has affected the forward curve.  Should August become hotter relative to last
 year, the forward curve could temporarily strengthen, boosting power price and
 earnings expectations near-term.  Ultimately, we think the principal cause of
 the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants.  Even if the
 curve temporarily strengthens due to weather, we still expect it will be
 downward sloping for the next several years.
 
 A Rebound in the Economy.  A weak economy has certainly affected power
 demand, which, in turn, has affected the forward curve.  When the economy
 eventually rebounds, which some are predicting by 4Q:01 or early 2002, the
 forward curve should strengthen.  We will watch for these signs and adjust our
 outlook accordingly.
 
 Cancellations of plant development plans.  This factor is a wildcard for the
 group in our opinion.  We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to
 cancel plant development plans.  So far, sources such as turbine manufacturer
 GE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled.  If/when
 they occur, the cancellation of development plans will have two effects.
 First, it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment, and
 would likely be perceived as negative.  Then, following the cancellation of
 enough development plans, it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power
 prices in the future.  This is why we think power prices will bottom in 2003.
 The mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will, in part, be driven by
 cancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter
 supply-demand balance.
 
 SUMMARY:  BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP.
 
 We are lowering ratings, price targets and/or estimates on 11 companies with
 exposure to the declining trend in power prices.  We advise investors to be
 more cautious on the group.  However, we continue to advise a shift toward
 Energy Merchants, who have little or no commodity price exposure, and away from
 Power Producers, who are long power, as well as those Integrated Utilities who
 are long power.  Additionally, we see several factors that also merit a
 cautious outlook, apart from the declining trend in power prices and its
 adverse effect on earnings:
 
 (1) Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market
 begins to recover and/or tech stocks begin to outperform.
 
 (2) Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a
 time when many other S&P 500 sectors have "rolled over."  The resumption of
 earnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away
 from our Growth Energy names, particularly if their earnings is now under
 challenge.
