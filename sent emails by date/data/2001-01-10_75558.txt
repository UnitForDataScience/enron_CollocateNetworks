 My vote would be to give George courtesy copies.
 
 

 
  
 
 
 I expect to be out of town Wednesday and Thursday of next week (don't
 worry, Ben can ALWAYS find me).  I would like to review the stuff before I
 leave town.  Could I come over Tuesday and give it a look?
 
 Do you guys think we need or should give Intergen the assignment docs and
 the bills of sale?
