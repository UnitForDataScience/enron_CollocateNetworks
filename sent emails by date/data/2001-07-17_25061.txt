 Mike, 
 
 I wish I was there to witness Dan in action. I will be next year for sure. Can't wait to see Johnny. Hopefully there are some single hotties at the wedding. There hasn't been a cougar sighting recently. Better hop. Talk to you later...

    Mike, 
 What's going on? It is hot as shit down here. I had to get a new # 
 because that crazy cougar was stalking me. It is 713-665-8145. Just 
 kidding my old phone company went belly up. I am really looking forward 
 to Matt and Jen's wedding. I bought a new lampshade to wear. Be sure to 
 get Matt all fucked up on the stag. Talk to you later.
