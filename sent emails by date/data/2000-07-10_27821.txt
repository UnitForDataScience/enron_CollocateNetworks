 me to get to DC is ok.  DF

 I got a call at 10:30 a.m. from George Briden indicating that his client's 
 plans were changed over the weekend and they will not be available to come to 
 Houston for tomorrow's meeting.  They will be in their Denver offices all 
 next week and suggested that we might meet up with them there.  Drew has 
 indicated his willingness to meet with them in Denver next week.     
 Given this change in events, I'd suggest that we pack-up a small contingent 
 to go to Denver and meet with them.  I'm thinking Terry or Ron, plus Steve 
 Harris (if available) and myself.  I don't have any dates/times yet.  I'll 
 call George and get his thoughts.  Will you EMail me back and let me know 
 what days/times will work for you next week?  Thanks.
