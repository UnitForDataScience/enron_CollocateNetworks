 BBC's Sambrook pledge to "get below the hype"
 
 BBC News director Richard Sambrook has vowed to improve the quality of his
 empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and "getting
 below the hype".
 
 In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
 officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
 Hall, says he is running a "fantastic operation". But, he admits, it
 "misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
 that we ought to".
 
 Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
 regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

 Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore
 
 Foreign broadcasters who "engage in the domestic politics of Singapore"
 could soon face restrictions.
 
 Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
 bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
 service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
 internal affairs.
 
 Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
 and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
 up until now broadcasters have been left alone.
 
 Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
 of right.
 
 He added: "Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
 advertising revenue to an errant channel."

 Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says
 
 The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
 activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
 director Jonathan Shier said.
 
 Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
 non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
 Melbourne by 40 percent.
 
 He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
 sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.
 
 Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a "stalking horse for
 getting rid of staff".

 Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC
 
 The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
 the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.
 
 According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
 personal protection.
 
 The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
 Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.
 
 Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
 programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
 away.
 
 MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: "Sunday may just have been a
 transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
 increase its audience and get more share."
 
 The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
 despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

 Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor
 
 The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
 corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
 province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
 incite more violence.
 
 The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
 bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
 Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
 government to censor the pictures.
 
 Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
 lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

 UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up
 
 The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
 political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.
 
 The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
 had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
 receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '"keep
 e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can".
 
 And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: "We are going to be extremely
 careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
 group."
