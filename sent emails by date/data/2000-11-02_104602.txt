 the CSA and will return a blackline to you shortly.  You may recall that SITA 
 expressly requested that the Enron agreement be governed by English law which 
 is why we prepared this document for execution by our affiliate in London 
 with the jurisdiction language appearing in the prior draft.  There are still 
 issues posed by your markup and we should be able to schedule a conference 
 call next week.  Thanks.  Sara
