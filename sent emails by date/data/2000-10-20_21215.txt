 assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented 
 by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number 
 will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be 
 tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I 
 need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate 
 of outside legal costs by business unit.
 
 Regards
 Delainey
