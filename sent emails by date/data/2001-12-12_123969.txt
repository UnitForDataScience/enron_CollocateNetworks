 Thanks,

 The following spreadsheet is a consolidation of counterparties that have not turned in termination letters.  I have also attached the list of terminations so that you can see the list we used.  If there are other counterparties that you know of that have not appeared on these lists, let me know and we will move them to the 'Bankruptcy Portfolio' we have set up.
 
 <<Non-Terminated Counterparties as of 12-7-2001.xls>> <<Financial Power Terminated.xls>> <<Physical Power Terminated.xls>> 
 
 Please let me know what other details you need and we will be happy to provide. 
 
 Thanks,
