 so there is no need to reevaluate
 our strategy at this stage.  We will simply proceed as planned to file a
 response in opposition to a stay of the appraisal proceeding and,
 simultaneously, a plea in abatement/motion for stay asking the judge to
 stay Intrust's common law claims pending the resolution of the appraisal
 proceeding.
 
 I will call you to check in with you about mid-day to get your thoughts.
 I will also have my cell phone with me, (713) 249-2677, and you can
 reach me there if need be.
 
 Thanks,
 
 KP
 
 P.S. - Could I trouble you to forward this on to Gene Humphrey and Mark
 Lay?  I'd like for them to know the drafting schedule, but I don't have
 their e-mail addresses.
