 expect) you should.  As I mentioned in my voicemail, I think the meeting will 
 not be particularly substantive;  more likely it is a photo op for the 
 governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators.  Based on your 
 message below, should we still plan to send somebody?  I still think we 
 should if we can manage the legal risk.
 
 Mike:  would you be able to attend as well?
 
 


  
  
 As I indicated in my VM, I will be in LA early Tues morning. Would you like 
 to talk about the isuues before your meeting
