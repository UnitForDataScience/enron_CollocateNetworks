 Dear Mr. Horn:
 
 Several weeks ago Chris Pacitti, of Austin Ventures, gave me your name as
 someone who might be interested in learning more about eLaw.com. I have
 attached an executive overview of our business for your review and would
 appreciate speaking with you about the business opportunity. I will call yo=
 u
 next week to schedule a mutually agreeable time to speak. I will call you a=
 t
 713-853-4520. If your phone number is different than the one Chris gave me,
 please let me know.
 
 Thank you in advance for your interest and I look forward to speaking with
 you soon.
