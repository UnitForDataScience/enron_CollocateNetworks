 Rodney-
 
 Merrill Lynch has reviewed the transaction that was executed with Enron in
 December, 1999 involving physically and financially settled call options on
 certain mid-continent peakers owned by Enron.  At that time, a fee of
 approximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction.
 
 Since the execution of the trade, Merrill Lynch has had to manage the risk
 associated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basis
 risks that Merrill Lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate the
 accounting treatment desired by Enron as part of the transaction.
 Additionally, as I am sure that you and your traders are aware, the position
 has considerably appreciated in value since trade execution.
 
 Even with these factors, Merrill Lynch is prepared to accommodate Enron's
 request to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million.
 This fee encompasses the original fee that Enron had agreed to pay to
 Merrill Lynch and does not take into consideration any of Merrill Lynch's
 hedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.
 
 Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to
 contact me.
 
 Regards, as always.
