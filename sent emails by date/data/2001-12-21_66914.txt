 First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
 while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
 command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.
 
 Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
 Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
 Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
 program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.
 
 DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
 program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.
 
 In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
 limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
 buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
 Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.
 
 Good luck.
