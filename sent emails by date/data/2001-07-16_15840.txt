 The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an "informational" hearing on 82XX at 
 1:30 PM PDT today.
 "Informational" means that there won't be a vote today.
 Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman 
 Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an "author"  of 82XX), 
 Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
 The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
 Dutra is unhappy with the process thus fardiscussed in 
 the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would 
 then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday.
 It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly 
 Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday.
 In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an 
 Edison "MOU," and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the 
 Senate side appears strained.
 The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are 
 generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no 
 Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.
 Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.
 
 Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.
 

 
 Best,
