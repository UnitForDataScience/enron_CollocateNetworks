 Jeff's response to this inquiry is:
 
 "No - just a social visit - he seems to be trying to make it soound like 
 something very different."
 
 Hope this helps - call if you need clarification.  Thanks, SRS

 Jeff,
 
 We spent quite a bit of time over the past several months discussing a 
 possible minority investment of about $5MM in Silicon Energy.  We have broken 
 off those discussions because (1) their proposed pre-money valuation of 
 $150MM was, in our opinion, excessive, and (2) our people at EES, who would 
 be the primary users of Silicon Energy, were not happy with Silicon Energy's 
 functionality.
 
 With this in mind, have you had discussions with John which we should know 
 about or which would help give us strategic direction?
 
 Thanks,
 Kevin W. Kuykendall

 ???? John, 
 
 ???? I just wanted to touch base and catch up on any recent developments. 
 ???? Assuming that your round has closed, who are the primary investors? 
 ???? What 
 ???? is your current schedule for an IPO? 
 
 ???? Also, I read a press release a few days ago regarding your partnership 
 ???? with 
 ???? Carrier.? It was quite interesting, especially after having talked 
 ???? with you 
 ???? regarding that project during my visit to your headquarters. 
 
 ???? Thanks, 
 ???? KK
