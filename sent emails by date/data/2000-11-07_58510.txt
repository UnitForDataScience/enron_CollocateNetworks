
 
 I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
 The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
 help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.  Please help 
 with the following information:
 Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin)  I want to make the point that the market 
 will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
 (and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
 Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
 courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
 credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the 
 price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
 these guys on board.
 Thanks.
