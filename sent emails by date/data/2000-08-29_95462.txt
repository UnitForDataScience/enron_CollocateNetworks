 To send the invitation to your guests/invitees, you may wish to use it as a
 file attachment in an email to them, or you may wish to print it and fax it
 to them individually.  It is designed in such a way to fax in a very clean
 manner.  Please let me know if you have any trouble with the file.
  
 Please instruct your guests/invitees to mail their checks as soon as
 possible, in order to get an accurate head count prior to the event.  The
 address is on the invitation, but here it is again: KBH Mesa Event, PO Box
 540962, Houston, TX 77254-0962.
  
 Thank you for your hard work to make the event a great success!
  
 Please call me if you have any questions.
