 > These changes look fine.  I have had further discussions with Tracy on
 > this
 > 10 day issue and we have a change that we would like to make. We would
 > like
 > to add language that would require SMUD within 3 Business Days of our
 > collateral request to send us an Officer's Certificate certifying that
 > Board Approval is required in order to post the collateral requested.  If
 > no approval is required, we feel that the extension of time is not
 > necessary.  Also, if you are posting cash,  should the extension apply?
 > If
 > so, why?
 >
 > Also, I still don't understand why the 10 day requirement should apply to
 > the "Transfer Date" concept which only requires the non-posting party to
 > pay the posting party interest each month on cash collateral that has been
 > posted.  Please explain.
