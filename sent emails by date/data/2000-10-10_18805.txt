 AB 970 is 10.7.  Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from 
 EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office).  
 Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.  URL for the 
 event is included below.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Given the current political climate and concerns about adequacy of energy 
 supplies, is someone at EES lobbying with politicians for certain 
 arrangements which could be beneficial to our business?  For example, would 
 there be interest in creating a tax credit/favorable deduction to incent 
 companies to invest in DSM assets to reduce energy consumption?  I can't 
 imagine that the political climate could be any better than now for a program 
 like this.
