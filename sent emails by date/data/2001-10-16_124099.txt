 Hi Hai:
 
   Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 
 
 1. other portfolios,
 2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
 3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,
 
 the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.
