 certain

 Sandy, I was again disapointed to hear that Union leaders are accusing Enron 
 as being unfriendly to Labor.  In the last 20 months we have pursued 
 construction on over 3000 MW of new generation capacity.  
 Enron Development Activity subject to Building & Construction Trade Labor 
 Agreements
 California 
  500 mw - PDEF - FeB. 99
  750 mw - PEF - Feb. 2000
 Indiana
  550 mw- Westfork Development -  Oct. 99
 Illinois
  680 mw - Lincoln Energy Facility - Nov 99 
 Tennessee
  540 mw -  Gleason Power I - Oct 99
 Oregon 
  240 mw - Coyote II (planned January 2001)
  Ethynol Plant - Columbia County - Baugh Const. June 2000
 
 Hopefully this will prove to be valuable information:  In addition to the 
 direct agreements, Enron is pursuing third party projects in Chicago and New 
 York City that will be subject to labor agreements.
 
 If the parties are interested, feel free to have them contact me directly 
 503-464-7548
