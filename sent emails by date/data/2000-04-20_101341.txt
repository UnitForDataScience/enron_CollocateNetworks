 experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint 
 ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the 
 Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation 
 of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with 
 the joint ownership

 Susan I need some regulatory help in determining some possible deal 
 structures.  We are working with Agave to develop a storage facility near the 
 West Tx lateral in Eddy County, NM.  My original thought was both parties 
 would share in the development costs and own equity interests in the 
 facility.  TW would then lease out storage space to shippers plus use storage 
 capacity to augment our Park N Ride capability.  The storage would be 
 connected via lateral to our W Tx line.
 
 But then it occurred to me how do we share ownership between regulated and 
 non-regulated entities?
 
 Do you have some time Friday morning to talk about this?  thanks
