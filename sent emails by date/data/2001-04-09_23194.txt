 Christopher -
 
 Help me to understand the plan for the MSEB and GOM arbitrations for
 December, January and Interest.  In how many pieces do we anticipate
 submitting these arbitrations?  What strategy is behind the submission of
 separate submissions?
 
 I remember that we wanted to separate the MSEB January submission, at one
 point, to hasten the disposition of the misdeclaration issue.  Does this
 make sense given the events of the last few weeks and the sponsors'
 sentiments about additional capital for the project?
 
 Thanks,
 Bruce
