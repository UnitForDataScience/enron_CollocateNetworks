 weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a 
 great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

 Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
 skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

 Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of

 Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
 and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
 El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
 Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB
 
 If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.
