      Kevin, 
  
 ReliantEnergy, DukeEnergy, Entergy-Kochand many othertrading  firms claim to miss outon 75-80% of the arbitrage trading opportunities. We're areextensivelyworking with them tohelp spot those  lucrative spreads.
 iSpheres provides  enabling software for deploying meta applications around composite event  management. We are working to enableevent management for traders. Enabling  traders to define composite events around online marketplaces,  weather, generation, transmission, and other information. The  issue weaddressis enabling traders to synthesize all the  information and detect what is actionable. Huge opportunity and payback.  
 I'd loveto discussour capabilities,understand what problems types you are  working on, and where we might be of value.I'dlike  to arrange a 30 minute  introductory conference callwith you and  other appropriate folks at Enron.
 I have attached an Energy Use Case.
