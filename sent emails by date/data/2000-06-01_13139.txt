 vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.  I hope 
 that ELM has received the response by now.  Let me know if I need to do 
 anything else.  Michelle

 Hi Michelle. Unfortunately, this issue with Eddie Lynn Morgan is still alive. 
 I talked with Kim a few weeks ago and she mentioned that she sent her 
 write-up to you for your review - before sending it to Eddie Lynn. Do you 
 have a status update on when it will be ready to go to Eddie Lynn?
 
 Thanks Michelle!

 EL - I just spoke with Kim Melodick. As you indicated, she had not had an 
 opportunity to provide you with the final outcome of the email investigation. 
 She apologizes for this and will have a write up to you within 1 week from 
 today.
 
 Let me know if you don't receive it by next Wednesday. 
 
 thanks.
