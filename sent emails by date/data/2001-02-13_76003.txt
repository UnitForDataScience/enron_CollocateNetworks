 website.  I like the little videoscreen - how's that for a toy?  I'll go back 
 and look at the Toyota.

 Yes, 34 cents. I will bring home some 1 cent stamps tonight.
 Grass to dig up...sounds like the beds are getting bigger already...
 I like the sound of the Highlander.

 Good morning,
 
 Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits
 today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.
 
 So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard
 looks.
 
 I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is
 looking better, though.
 
 Hope you are having a good day.
 
 Love,
