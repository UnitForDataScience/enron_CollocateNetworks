 on the purchase on the replacement equipment.

 The Unit Liability Amount for the Salmon Energy Agreement is currently
 $14,103,675, yet Lee Johnson's e-mail (contained herein) indicates that
 the price for Unit 28 is $15,769,725.  Looks like we may have to
 increase the Maximum Liability Amount, Unit Liability Amount and the
 payments under the payment schedule.  Let me know how what you think. 
 
 
 
 

 


 
  
 
 
      Attached please find a clean copy of the Salmon Energy Turbine
 Agreement (the second document below), which includes Lee Johnson's
 proposed changes to Section 10.7, as well as a blackline (first document
 below) showing changes to the (3/27) version you forwarded earlier
 today. I have include notes within the agreement indicationg those
 places where questions remain - e.g., how the addition of the new
 turbine affects the pricing schedule, guaranteed delivery, etc.
