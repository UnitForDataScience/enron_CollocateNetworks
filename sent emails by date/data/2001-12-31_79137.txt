      I've had this removed from numerous users so far due to the cost.  We'll have this down to three or four users in the next week or so.

 Caroline Barnes has asked if you would scan the ETS systems to identify who has the PROPHETX software installed.  We're concerned about the name...it could be PROFITX.  However, Danny McCarty has it installed, so you could check the spelling there.
 
 Would you please provide her with a report?  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 33270 or Caroline at 36375.
 
 Thanks,
 Chris
