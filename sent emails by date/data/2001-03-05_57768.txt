 for preventing price caps and California's attempts to secede from the grid.  
 We need to keep pushing information to them regarding these issues.  Attached 
 is some text I have been using for correspondence with policy makers 
 regarding California issues.  Feel free to use it.

 Gentlemenhow do we want to 
 follow up on that request?
 
 Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed 
 with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door 
 open to future discussions.  Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for 
 now.
 
 We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt.  I will continue to 
 work on setting that up.  Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to 
 meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock 
 on that door.  We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some 
 commercial reasons.
 
 There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, 
 etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.
