 Dale Nesbitt is a consultant who develops pricing models (spot and fwd)
 prices for E-commerce sites. He will be in Houston in the beginning of July.
 Any interest in meeting him?

 U.S. and world oil
 and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first
 web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American
 electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an
 integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs
 the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
 quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
 or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do
 so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do
 so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly
 available.
 
 I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the
 discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.
 I plan to be there the last week in June.
 
 Thanks again for all your help and support.
 
 Dale
