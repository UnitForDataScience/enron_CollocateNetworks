 With the Holidays upon us, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your contributions to our company.  
 
 I appreciate your continued dedication.  These are challenging times at Enron, and once again, the employees of Enron Global Services and Enron Transportation Services continue to set the standard for excellence.   Thank you.
 
 Best wishes for a Happy Holiday and a safe and prosperous 2002.
