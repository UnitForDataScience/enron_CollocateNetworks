 Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
 under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
 and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  
 
 All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
 Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
 away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
 contract under both desk.
