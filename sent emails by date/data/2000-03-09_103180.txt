 Nony's message indicates below, I think I lost the link.  We need to keep=
 =20
 this link in mind (as well as updates since Alan has just updated Japan, fo=
 r=20
 example) when identifying resources for swap lawyers.  I'll schedule a shor=
 t=20
 meeting for us to recap soon.  Sara

 Please bear in mind that the survey contains proprietary information of ECT=

 and is not to be reproduced, copied or disseminated without the prior writt=

 consent of a member of the ECT Office of General Counsel.
 
 We envision that this database will eventually include all other foreign=20
 jurisdictions that are similarly surveyed in the future.  This data base is=
 =20
 not limited to Trading legal matters.  It can easily be supplemented to=20
 include legal memoranda and opinions related to domestic issues or to=20
 accommodate other areas relevant to the businesses supported by ECT Legal. =

 If your group has been involved in similar surveys and would like to=20
 incorporate such data into the Jurisdictional Library Database, please let=

 Nony Flores know.
 
 If you have any questions regarding the survey or other available=20
 information, please do not hesitate to contact me or Nony Flores.
