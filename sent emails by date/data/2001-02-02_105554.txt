 Please refer to Janelle's request for a draft confirm.  The  counterparty's 
 draft has a floating price reference and you should verify with Janelle.  Use 
 the ISDA format; the counterparty is the "Power Authority for the State of 
 New York".  Ignore the "junk" in the counterparty's form.  I have no other 
 info about the particular deal.  Call if you have any questions and please 
 send me a copy.  SS

 Hi, Janelle - Per our conversation this morning, the appropriate contact
 would be Jackie Kmiotek-Welsh in our Legal Dept.  You can e-mail her the
 agreement with the desired changes (redline) to her. If you could cc Terryl,
 Leon, and myself on the e-mail, that would be great.
 
 Jackie's telephone number is (914)390-8019.  Any questions, please contact
 us.
