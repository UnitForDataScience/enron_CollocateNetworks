 Can you have someone do this?  I forgot to put it on the group's To Do list for the week.  (Besides, I thought I would do it myself, but never seem to find time).

 I am helping Ed Baughman negotiate a final settlement with PSEG, and was wondering if you could send me the final Nov and Dec numbers for Fin and Phy gas, Fin and Phy Power and Emissions.  Please let me know when you expect to have the numbers available.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.
 
 Thanks,
 Laurel Bolt
