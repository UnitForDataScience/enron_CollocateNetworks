 Doug Gilbert-Smith talked with me today about some issues in ERCOT.  I think it would be beneficial to have a 1/2 day or so meeting in Houston with all of our Texas team, bringing in Doug and the EES traders and EES/ENA attorneys after we have chatted first.  If ok with all of you, I'll have my assistant set it up early Sept.
