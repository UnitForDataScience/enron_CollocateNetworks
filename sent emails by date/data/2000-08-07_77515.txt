 Just wanted you to know that I received your email, and will follow through 
 on the change order.  I should be in the office on Thursday am, if not 
 sooner. As you can see, I'm picking up email, and can also be reached on my 
 cell phone.
 
 I reviewed your email re: VEPCO. We do have a project entity to use, and 
 Accounting (and Global Finace) have been involved on the MTM and off  balance 
 sheet issues.  I suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee 
 soon.   
 
 It was good to get your input on VEPCO. There's lots to do on that one.

 Kay and Kathy:
 
 Please make the effective date of the change order the date of execution. I 
 have separately followed up on Lisa's DASH question, and we should be in a 
 position to execute the change order after this is clarified.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben

 Kay & Scott:
 
 Attached is a revised draft of Change Order #2 for your review.  
 
 Since the draft of 7/20/00, we have added two additional exhaust stacks at 
 $233,000/Unit.
