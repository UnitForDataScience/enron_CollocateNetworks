 hello all,
 
 After spending much time on the phone with Aquila, it was requested by them 
 (Scott Eckermann, Contracts and Terry Batt, Credit) that we take active 
 measures internally to limit the product profile of both Aquila Risk 
 Management and Aquila Energy Marketing to their respective trading 
 competencies.  Aquila Risk trades financially under an existing Master 
 Agreement and Aquila Energy Marketing trades physically under existing Master 
 Physical Agreements.  I informed Aquila that we would make changes to their 
 profiles after the market closes today.  If we should not take such action at 
 this time, please call me at 713-853-9897.
 
 thanks
 brant
