
 
 David, thanks for the people listing.
 
 Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each 
 market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads 
 and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 
 budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES 
 business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current 
 balance sheet would be helpful as well.
 
 I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.
 
 You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.
 
 Regards
 Delainey

 I would suggest day one in Sao Paulo and day two and three in Rio.  I would 
 also suggest the Cesar Park in Rio, better location, although Copacabana 
 Palace is more famous and classy hotel.  Trip from Rio to Sao Paulo is like 
 from Houston to Dallas, inconsequential, spend the first night in Sao Paulo, 
 hotel next to the office, and second night in Rio, travel to Rio on Friday 
 morning.  Dave, call to discuss or I'll call you, including what would you 
 like to do on Saturday, sightseeing, golf, surfing, work?
 
 


 
  
 I thought this Itinerary might be easier to read.  If you could send me the 
 phone number to the Rio de Janeiro office, I would greatly appreciate it.
 
 Also, Dave wanted to know if you could arrange transportation for them.  He 
 wants to be sure that we arrange transportation with someone you know.
 
 Thanks very much for your help and please feel free to call me with any 
 questions (Kay 713-853-0643).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Kay
