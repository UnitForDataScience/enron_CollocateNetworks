 Per our (separate) discussions, I have revised the GTCs to reflect (i) the
 counterparty's representation that it is a domestic corporation (which, if
 correct, would permit us to avoid back-up withholding on reportable
 payments, if any, made pursuant to this GTC) and (ii) the requirement that
 we provide the relevant forms to the counterparty in the event the
 counterparty notifies us that it is not a domestic corporation.
