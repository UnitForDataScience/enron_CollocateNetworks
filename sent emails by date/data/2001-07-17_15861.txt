 They are being contacted and should oppose if they think about it twice.

 Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
 Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
 anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
 binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
 exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
 discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day
