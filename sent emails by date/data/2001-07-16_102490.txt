 Actually, we're coming this weekend.  We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San Juan's (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.
 
 Thanks again,
 Susan
 
 
  

    
 
 Hi Bonnie,
 
 How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
 been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
 public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
 some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
 of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
 your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
 still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
 like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
 for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
 offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
 in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
 research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
 restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
 maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.
 
 Thanks a bunch,
 Susan
