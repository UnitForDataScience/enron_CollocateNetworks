 I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.  It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.
