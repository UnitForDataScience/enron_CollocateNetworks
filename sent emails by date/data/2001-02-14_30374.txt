 John,
 
 Per our conversation......
 
 Once HR moves these employees from payroll 0584 to payroll 0012 they will be out of ETS's jurisdiction.  It stands to reason when these people are moved they will be in a new ENA cost center .    It would be helpful to know who these employees are.

 Please do whatever needs to be done to facilitate this.  Let me know if I can help. We want to be sure that those people start hitting0012 instead of 0584.  Thanks.

 Effective 2/16/01, approximately 65 employees will move over to HPL Co. 0012.  Please have Corporate and ETS charges to Co. 0584 stop as soon as possible as we will not be able to charge them to ENA.  These should be charged instead to Co. 0012.
 
 Karen, if you have any specific comments on this please let me know as soon as possible.
