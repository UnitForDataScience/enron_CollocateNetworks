 Can you answer this?
 
 I love you.
 But on the
 one from camp it says Copy C for payer or State Copy, Copy B for Recipient
 (Keep for your records).  So which one do I send?  The one from the school
 says send B but I'm confused on the other one.
 What did the doctor say about Tonya & the due date? Love, Ma
