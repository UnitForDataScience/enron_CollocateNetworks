 Kupiecki sent me an e-mail this morning about getting together for our
 project soon.  How does Tuesday at break sound?
 
 

 
  
 
 Hi Kelly,
 
 What do you think about the idea of getting our group together to talk 
 about the finance project soon?  If we wait too long, it will sneak up on
 us.
 
 Cheers,
