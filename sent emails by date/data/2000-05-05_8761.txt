 have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may 
 want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then 
 returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from 
 that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out 
 of the flat by the 18th of May?  or even Wednesday, May 10.)
 
 Cheers,

 Tom,
 
 I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in 
 the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I 
 heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today 
 !!!!
