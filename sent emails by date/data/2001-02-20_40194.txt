 Attached is a presentation of the NYISO Working Group on "Principles of
 Market-Based Expansion Process".  It discusses the free rider problem of
 market based transmission expansion.  The section titled "The Devil is in
 the Details" describes a proposal for paying the transmission investor for
 the reinforcement - the transmission investor would receive one half of the
 difference in congestion charges between the with and without reinforcement
 cases.
 
 This proposal was developed last fall for the NYISO.  More discussions are
 planned to determine the feasibility of the proposal.  The contact I have is
