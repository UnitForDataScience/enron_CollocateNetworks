 the next 10 months.  hopefully this is it.  
 you gotta love heffner...'if we take out the jan 31 low there is NO WAY 
 anything bullish can happen'
 
 
 
 
 


   
 
 
 thats what we wanna hear
 keeping
 them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
 southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
 breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
 weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
 to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
 the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
 All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
 with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.
 
 More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
 available with the 6:30am ET release.
