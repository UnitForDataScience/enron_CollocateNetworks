 Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.  Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?

    Dave  and Gerald,
 
    I just  wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood give
    you any  problems?  I hope all is well.
 
    Thanks,
