 for next year.

 Tim,
 
 Dave Delainey is looking for a target customer list, coverage metrics and 
 goal and objectives for each of your teams:
 
  West Power Trading
  West Power Mid-Market/Services
  West Power Fundamentals/Structuring
 
 Obviously his proposed breakout of your teams (noted above) is different from 
 the way we planned them.  For expense purposes, do you want me to add Volume 
 Management, Real-Time, Pre-Scheduling and Admins to West Power Trading?  
 
 Unfortunately, we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this 
 information by the end of the week.  Do you think you can provide this 
 information to me by Thursday?  Also, if you could let me know today about 
 the expense breakout, I can start working on that now.
 
 Thanks, Paula.
