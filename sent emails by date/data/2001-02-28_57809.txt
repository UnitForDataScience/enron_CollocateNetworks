 approval process and provide bonuses to builders who finish before July. 
 The state also established an $800 million conservation program this year. 
 But Borenstein said that many of the ideas floating around for spending the 
 conservation money are for efforts that would not help for about another 
 three years. 
 ON NATIONAL MATTERS
 During yesterday's show, Davis also weighed in on President Bush's tax-cut 
 proposal and former President Bill Clinton's controversial last-minute 
 pardons. 
 The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available, he 
 said. 
 "All of us who have been in government for a while have seen the roller- 
 coaster ride of surpluses and then shortages and surpluses and shortages," he 
 said. "Clearly, people need tax relief, but it should be moderated to the 
 point where we don't kill the golden goose, which is a strong, growing 
 economy. " 
 Although he received a significant campaign donation from the father of 
 Carlos Vignali, the Los Angeles drug kingpin, Davis told show host Tim 
 Russert that he never spoke with the family about the presidential pardon 
 Vignali received on Clinton's last day in office. 
 Davis said he did not have enough information to know whether the pardon was 
 a mistake, but, he said, "there's something about them in general that 
 doesn't ring right." 
 "However," he said, "people expect us to focus on things that matter to them, 
 and they really want to see progress on education, the environment, tax 
 relief, health care." 
 Asked by Russert whether he is going to run for president in 2004, Davis did 
 not rule it out but said that only re-election to the governorship in 2002 is 
 on his horizon. 
 "I'm focused on keeping the lights on and making our schools better," he 
 said.
