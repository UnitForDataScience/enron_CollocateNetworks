 At the request of Darren Vanek in Credit, we have done some preliminary due 
 diligence regarding the ability of The Public Service Company of New Mexico 
 to enter into financial transactions.  Based on our conversations with them 
 and review of their Board Resolution, it appears:
 
 1.  They are an investor owned utility, not a governmental entity
 2.  Their Board Resolution ONLY approves electricity futures, options or 
 swaps, and gas or oil futures, options or swaps.  
 3.  THEY CANNOT ENTER INTO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OVER 18 MONTHS.  It is 
 imperative that anyone trading with this counterparty be made aware of this 
 restriction
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.
