 Shelley, 
 
 Per my conversation with Mary Kay, attached is a resume for Chris Miller.  I know Chris well and believe he has the strong communication skills, intellect and drive that it takes to contribute to the ETS team.  For these reasons, I would like to recommend Chris for a position within your group. 
 
 Please give me a call if you have any questions or would like to discuss.  Thank you for your consideration.  See you soon!
