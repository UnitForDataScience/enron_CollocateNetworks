 We have a separate group in legal that puts these together.  Ed and I are not 
 involved in the preparation or negotiation of swap agreements.  The group  in 
 legal that works on them is led by Mark Taylor (x37459).  Others in the group 
 are Carol St. Clair (x33989), Sara Shackleton (x35620) and Shari Stack 
 (x39477).  I suggest that you contact any one of those people.  If I can 
 assist, please let me know.

 Hello Bob and Ed.
 
 What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
 with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
 through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
 solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
 outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
 Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
 and our solutions will involve financial swaps.
 
 
 Thank you. Tim
