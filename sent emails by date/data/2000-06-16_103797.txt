 Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
 (2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.
 
 
 This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
 for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
 effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
 (RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
 depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
 definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.
 
 The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
 and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
 which are detailed in the form itself.
 
 Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
 hesitate to get in touch.
