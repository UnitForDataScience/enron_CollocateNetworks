 I had a great time too.  next time when the carpet is in, we can have a 
 little carpet picnic and watch the 8:00!  by the way...I am still full.  Have 
 you ever seen a girl put away so much dessert?  I am actually known for it!  
 Mark almost died the first time he saw me eat dessert!!!  I am only coming 
 for dinner again if you promise we can have homemade whipped cream.  I think 
 it is one of the only white things that I like to eat.
 
 

   
 You know, we've done something the last few tuesdays, and it is now my 
 favorite day of the week!  I had a great time.
