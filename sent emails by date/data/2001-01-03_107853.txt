 Janie,
 
 Per our telephone conversation, I am attaching my resume for your review. As 
 we discussed, I am seeking a permanent (Manager level) position where my 
 finance and origination skills would be best leveraged.  I am very interested 
 in a role in financing and/or orginating energy deals - wholesale or retail.  
 If you or one of the groups interested in interviewing me require a 
 reference, please contact my current supervisor, Rob Gay, or current and 
 former colleagues Peter Anderson and Greg Blair, respectively. 
 
 Thanks again for your help and advice.
 
 Regards,
 Tracee
