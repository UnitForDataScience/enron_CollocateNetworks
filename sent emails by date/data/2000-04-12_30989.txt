 This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing 
 equals Enron's Sitara pricing. 
 
 Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and 
 no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still 
 needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done 
 yet.
 
 CES DEAL TICKETS
 gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070 
 term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
 volume = 5000
 
 gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
 term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
 volume = 5000
 
 
 
 ENA DEAL TICKETS
 135702 = 5000.
 It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29
 
 
 145321 = 10,000
 This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April 
 forward deal # is 227296).
 
 The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.
 
 Thank you for your assistance.
