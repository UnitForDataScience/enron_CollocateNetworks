         Mark,
 
         I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed
 Conditions to
         Special Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land
 Development
    the
         Owner?  Will it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow
 payment
    prior to
         exercising the relevant land options and the commencement of
    construction?
 
         I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the
    deposit
         would impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from
 Fred
    that
         we are not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this
    project.
 
         Kay

         As you know we are scheduled to appear before the Livingston
 County
    Zoning
         Board of Appeals ("ZBA") tomorrow evening for initial approval
 of
    the
         Livingston Energy Center (the "Facility").  Assuming, we
 receive a
    vote to
         approve the Facility, the ZBA will be approving the Conditions
 of
    Approval
         of the Special Use sent out yesterday for everyone's final
 approval
    and
         sign-off.   Please note that we have incorporated into these
    conditions the
         stormwater management conditions, township and county highway
    roadway
         conditions, and other matters. If there are any changes or
    modifications to
         these conditions, our ability to incorporate may be limited if
 they
    are not
         received by 4pm today.  Of course, if necessary, we will
 attempt to
    make
         modifications after that time.
 
         It is possible based on on-going negotiations with the County
 and
    our
         neighbors that additional changes may be required today or
 tomorrow.
    We
         will of course contact you immediately if that occurs.  If you
 have
    any
         questions, please do not hesitate to call or email Karen or me.
    Thanks.
