 settlement I negotiated.  I'm the person on the floor who is familiar with 
 the services we purchase.

 Lysa,
 
 Please view the attachment and download the BPA tariff filing to the p: drive 
 and let me know where it is.  If you have trouble downloading fromt the FERC 
 site, try BPA (my guess is that it will be easier to get from BPA than 
 through FERC).
 
 This can wait until next week.
 
 
 Thank you,
 
 Alan Comnes
