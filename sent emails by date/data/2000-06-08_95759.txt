 Mike - 
 
 I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the 
 WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them 
 against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this 
 requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing 
 this agreement unless there are any significant issues.  
 
 Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working 
 on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is 
 281-297-3582.
 
 Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent 
 us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not 
 think sleeving is the answer.
 
 Thanks,
 Rogers
