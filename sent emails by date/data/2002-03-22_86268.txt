Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained in the price report. I would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price.

 I have asked Ed McMichael to spend some time with you in the next 1-2 days to get better acquainted with the retail gas business.
 
 Thanks for your cooperation
