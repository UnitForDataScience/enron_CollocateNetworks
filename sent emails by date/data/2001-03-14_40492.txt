 The $150 "soft price" cap that FERC adopted in its December 15 order applies 
 only to sales of power into the California ISO market and California PX 
 day-aheadand day-of markets.  These are the real-time and short-term markets, 
 respectively.   By the terms of the December 15 order, the cap does not apply 
 to any bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of 
 Water Resources (CDWR), which are generally for longer terms.
 
 Given the instability of the California market, the current applicability of 
 the cap may change in the future.  In a recentlly released report, FERC staff 
 recommends that the cap be discontinued after April 2001 and replace by a 
 series of other measures to mitigate market power.  Thes include a marginal 
 cost price cap on sales into the ISO by sellers who are party to the 
 participating generator agreement.
 
 Although unlikely, it is not inconceivable that someone in the future might 
 argue that the role currently being performed by CDWR is in some respects the 
 same role as was formerly performed by the PX.  Based on that proposiiton, it 
 might be argued that a price cap similar to the "soft price" cap  be imposed 
 on sales to the CDWR.
