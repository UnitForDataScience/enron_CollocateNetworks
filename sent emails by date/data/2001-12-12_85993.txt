 Bob:
 
 I spoke with Duane Harris from PB-KBB (Tommy Smith's boss) regarding the Napoleanville work.  I briefed him on how the pre and post bankruptcy invoices will be treated.  They are willing to keep working provided we do the following:
 
 1.	Provide an accounting of what invoices are pre and what invoices are post bankruptcy - so we can get on the same page with them regarding the numbers.
 
 2.	Put in place a new contract between PB-KBB and the Estate to cover post bankruptcy work.  Please work with G. Nemec to develop the form of the contract that we want to propose to the cash committee.
 
 3.	He also wants to have a discussion with regard to the pre-bankruptcy invoices, but he realizes he is an unsecrued creditor with respect to this work.
 
 Lets you, Stuart and I chat by the end of the day to see where you are on this. 
 
 Thanks,
 Brian
