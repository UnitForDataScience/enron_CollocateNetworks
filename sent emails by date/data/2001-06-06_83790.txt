 Charles & Scott,
 
 I wanted to circle back with both you with respect to employment
 opportunities at Enron.  I am in the process of narrowing potential
 opportunities.  As such, is there currently an opportunity to move forward
 with Enron?  If so, please feel free to contact me.  In any event, I
 appreciate your consideration.
