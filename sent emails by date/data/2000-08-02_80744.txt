 keynote and our group has participated with Bob, Suzanne's husband, before.  
 This is the conference when we came out with EOL last year.

 Bob, thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well.  Chris and
 I both enjoyed our discussion and introductions at the dinner too.
 
 As far as the 9 initiatives, that number includes all of our activities not
 just new ones.  We don't have 9 being cranked out in 90 days, at least not
 yet!
 
 When we get closer to your conference, I would be happy to give you a count
 for your intro. with Jeff.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike

 Mike,
 
 Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this
 morning.
 I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures
 underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just
 90 days.
 
 I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard
 you
 incorrectly.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Bob Nimocks
 
 P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000,
 Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on
 the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th.
