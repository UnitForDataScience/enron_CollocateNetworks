 here are my minor comments as marked.  I would regard a "bid" in the context 
 of an auction as a legal offer.

 Mark,
 
 I have suggested a few changes on the attached, redlined version.
 
 Please let me know if you think these are appropriate.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 


 
  
 Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the 
 "auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" 
 button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the 
 counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here 
 is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve 
 price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other 
 parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will 
 be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?
