 What's the link??  Two nights in Banff would be good, then Calgary.  Or vice
 versa.  Is it easier to get teetimes in Banff during the week?  Twilight is
 OK, if they have it there.  We'll just let Dad take a nap in the afternoon
 while we party!  Luv, Mom
 
 

 
  
 
 
 Great!
 
 I'll start planning things here.  What do you want to do about
 accomodations?  Would
 you guys like to make it a golfing vacation?
 
 love,
 coop

 fun in Portland.  Luv, Mom
