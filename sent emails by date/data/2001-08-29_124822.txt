 Sorry to hear about Racheal...so the Bretts weren't gay? But what about Nancy...
 I haven't been to the Breakroom. I think I will be coming up to Seattle on either Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. I haven't decided yet. I am taking Friday off from work though...my birthday is on Thursday...isn't your birthday here in the tail end of August

    
 
 Ok, I got you a ticket for Sep. 1 that is a Sat.  show starts and 9:00.
