 Stella:
 
 I need the above referenced contract put into POPS for January, May, June , 
 July, and August 1999 forward.  I need the contract in POPS for August 
 forward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.
 
 In 1998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South 
 Texas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-62210-101 and a Global number 
 of 96016880 by Karen Lambert.  Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by 
 Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.  In 1999, when Copano began 
 allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and 
 yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.  Karen sent me an e-mail 
 indicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase - 
 Global # 96022367 (I don't have a "Synergi" contract number).  I know that in 
 3/99 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.
 
 I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so 
 that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.  I have not allocated 
 any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.  Karen is the most 
 knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be 
 directed to her regarding contract issues.  Karen worked with Bernard Widacki 
 at Copano to set up the contract originally.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Fred
