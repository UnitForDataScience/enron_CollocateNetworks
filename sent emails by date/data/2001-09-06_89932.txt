
 
 The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.   I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.
 
 Therefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks.

 Dan has informed me that Enron's share of remaining costs in the Enron v. FERC matter will not exceed $4,000, for the work done to prepare for oral argument scheduled for November 7, 2001.
 
 If you need a more formal document indicating this, I would be happy to send one to you.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
