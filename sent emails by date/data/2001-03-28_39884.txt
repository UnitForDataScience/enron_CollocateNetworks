
 
 Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
 contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
 California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
 and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " 
 future California", we propose the following changes:
 
 1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
 Commodities  in the PGE/SCE 
 situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) 
 option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on "inability to pay 
 debts as they become due".
 
 Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
 or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
 will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
 to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially 
 improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range 
 goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a 
 single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements.
