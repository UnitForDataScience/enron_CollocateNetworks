
 
 This is some of the data that we need...
  they have had me on a 2 year contract  (not sure if they do that in 
 Houston, but I am willing)  which had some annual cash kickers)
 
 
 We can discuss when I get there, but in case you need it next week, just 
 thought it couldn't hurt.
 
 
 Looking forward to a fresh start and new challenges.
 
 
 see you soon
 
 Beth
