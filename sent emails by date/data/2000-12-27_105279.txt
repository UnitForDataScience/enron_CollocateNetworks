 As discussed, the RBC/Enron swap confirmation needs to be amended so that the 
 Pricing Dates are subject to the Preceding Business Day Convention.? As the 
 original commodity swap confirmation was prepared by Enron therefore, can you 
 please send out an amended confirmation which deletes Floating Price and 
 Pricing Date(s) in its entirety and replaces it with the attached.? The 
 amended confirmation should be sent to Ruth-Ann Marchis for signature.? Her 
 fax number is 416-842-4314.
 
 Please call me with and questions or comments.
