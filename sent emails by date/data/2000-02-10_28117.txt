 it to our commercial people for a quick double check.  If you don't hear from 
 me by Monday, ET&S is OK.  Thanks.  DF

 Please find the attached memo summarizing a proposed joint venture between 
 Enron North America and Texaco involving our respective intrastate pipeline 
 assets in Louisiana (i.e., Enron's LRC pipeline).  The joint venture would 
 restrict Enron and its affiliates from pursuing certain limited business 
 opportunities involving specified pipeline assets that may be competitive 
 with the joint venture.  Specifically, these assets include: 
 
 (i) the Acadian Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
 Petroleum Inc. USA), 
 (ii) the Cypress Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
 Petroleum Inc. USA), 
 (iii) the Louisiana Intrastate Gas System (currently ultimately owned by 
 American Electric Power Co. Inc.), 
 (iv) the Louisiana Gas System (currently ultimately owned by Conoco Inc.); 
 and 
 (v) the Louisiana gas pipeline assets of Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. (currently 
 ultimately owned by Koch Industries).  
 
 In keeping with Enron's internal policies, we are seeking your confirmation 
 that you have no objection to the non-compete provisions in this 
 transaction.  Please feel free to call Lance Schuler, Hal Bertram or me if 
 you have any questions.
 
 Regards,
 Brian
