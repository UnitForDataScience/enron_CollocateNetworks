 including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on 
 the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be 
 administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it 
 (lunch will be served)
  Project Big Horn (subject to Karen's availability)
 
 The meeting will be held from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB30C1.
