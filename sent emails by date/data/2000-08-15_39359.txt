
 
 Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
 jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:
 
 1.    Anti-trust  this training has been completed in Portland, but 
 needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
 to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 
 
 Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
 power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
 meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.
