      Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
 ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
 narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
 eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
 column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
 misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away
 Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
 following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
 (See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
 I.99-07-003).doc)
