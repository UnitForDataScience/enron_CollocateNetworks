
 
 Your list looked good and I approved all as reviewers.  We can talk about how the VP PRC process works - there will be an opportunity there to provide info to various commercial MD's that will be in attendance at the meeting.  We will make sure that we prepare the attendees well.   but it is worth a shot.
 
 I am open to any suggesions you have
