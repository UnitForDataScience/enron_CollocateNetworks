 Impact on EGM
 In August 1999, all NAICS (SIC) codes except Pulp and Paper and Steel 
 reverted to EES in September 2000. This includes Refining, Petchems, 
 Transport, Chemicals, Coal, Ags, etc...They a model "Value Enhancement" that  
 shows an itemized account of a customer's VAR by commodity (metals, plastics, 
 petchems,
 products, gas, power, etc). They planon covering the whole universe of risk 
 management. Obviously we need to manage the relationship with EES.
 
 Next Steps:
 Meet with Mike Mann. I have his target list. We probably need to see how we 
 help them bring business to the EGM books, since they are cross-selling 
 everything.
 
 Let me know what you want to do.
