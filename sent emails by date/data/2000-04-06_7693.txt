 would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and 
 that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to 
 contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow 
 up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep 
 Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) 
 updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  

    
 
 
 Sue:  Thanks for your email.  In speaking with Rick Causey, the only day
 that he is available is Monday, April 24.  In speaking with Sally Beck, I
 know that you are confirming the 3 winners and will get me their info once
 they have been chosen.  If you don't mind seeing who from the university is
 available on the 24th, that would be great.  Our other option is to have it
 another evening that week or rescheduling for the fall after classes begin.
 
 As I mentioned before, I am expecting a baby two weeks from today, so I'd
 love to have as much of this wrapped up before I pass it on to someone else
 on my team.
 
 Thanks for your help!
 Elyse
