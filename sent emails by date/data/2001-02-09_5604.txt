 I would like to see the Mandell and the Huldy - preferably tomorrow before 
 4ish.  Let me know if that works for you.  Dad is welcome to see whichever 
 houses he would like.
 
 FYI, I am meeting with Bob Dunn today after work, and I made copies of the 
 contracts.

 Hi Eric,
 
 Do you want me to check with the realtors to see if those houses are open
 this weekend and, if not, do you want me to make appts.?  Let me know.  I'll
 do that today.  I would like Dad to see Mandell but that's up to you.  He
 can't do it today, I don't think.  But, if you would like to see something
 today, I'll try to arrange it.  I would prefer to see all of them the same
 day but I will leave the up to you.  I didn't want you to think that I have
 forgotten about you.  Did you download the contract and make copies?  LU-M
