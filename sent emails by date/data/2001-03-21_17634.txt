 "unanimously."  I think that there was 1 nay vote.
 The statement is made that "the utilities were required to sell off most of 
 their generating capacity."  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 
 of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to 
 about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of 
 the remainder of their fossil-fired plants.
 It is stated that stranded costs are "investments in imprudent power 
 generation facilities."  These investments were in fact found in the past to 
 be prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them 
 imprudent now.
 Is it now "virtually impossible to manage commodity risk" in California?  
 Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation 
 somewhat.
 From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing 
 UC/CSU in the following manner, "It was actually a relatively easy decision 
 to make."  Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed.
