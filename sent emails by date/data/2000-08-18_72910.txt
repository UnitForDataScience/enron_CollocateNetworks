 bill sherk met w/ ncng officials yesterday.  they indicated they felt the
 city would have the right to serve the site and hinted they would not
 contest.  however, they said they "had to check with their operations
 people" to determine if their pipeline and system at that location would
 support/provide the needed pressure and volume for the enron plant.  this
 may be the 'catch' we all expect.  however, atleast they appear not to be
 readying themselves for a legal fight over service.  bill will advise enron
 of these latest developments..
