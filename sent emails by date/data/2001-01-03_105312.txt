 Unless Mary has addressed already or a different plan is in place, can you 
 handle?  Sara
  

 











  
 Attached are first drafts of the following documents to be used in 
 connection with the insertion of an insurance company into the 
 transaction: (1) Assignment and Waiver Agreement, (2) Swap Confirmation 
 between the Agent and the Insurance Company (blacklined against the 
 current Cerberus Swap Confirmation) and (3) Instrument of Assignment 
 whereby Aeneas will assign the balance of its note to RBC (blacklined 
 against the Assignment executed on November 30, 2000). 
 ? 
 With regard to the Swap schedule to be entered into between the Agent 
 and the Insurance Company, it would be helpful to know whether RBC and 
 the Insurance Company have entered into any recent Swap transactions so 
 we can follow the general provisions. 
 ? 
 I believe that RBC was going to produce a draft Swap confirmation for 
 the Swap to be entered into between ENA and the Insurance Company, but 
 please could RBC confirm.? It also would be helpful to see an example of 
 a Swap schedule which may have been entered into between Enron and the 
 Insurance Company in a different transaction (if one exists). 
 ? 
 With regard to the Sales Agency Agreement, it would be our preference 
 still to have RBC as the party to the Sales Agency Agreement, but 
 agreeing to act at the direction of the Insurance Company in certain 
 circumstances. 
 ? 
 I will be in our Houston office for most of Thursday in Conference Room 
 42 Main at 713-220-4242, returning to Dallas Thursday evening when I 
 will be contactable at 214-659-4645.
