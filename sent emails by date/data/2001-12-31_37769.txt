 Dearest Santa, 
 We don't have a chimney  in our house, how do you get into our 
 home?  
 Love, Marky 
 Mark, 
 First, stop calling yourself  "Marky", it sounds gay. That's why 
 you're getting your  ass whipped at school.  Second, you don't 
 live in a  house, you live in a low-rent apartment complex. 
 Third,  I get inside your pad just like your mother's boyfriend 
 does, thru the bedroom window. 
 Sweet  Dreams, 
 Santa
