 I have been assisting Ron Bertrand in reviewing the proposed Confidentiality Agreement between Enron and AEGIS.  The original proposal was for a confidentiality agreement running to the benefit of AEGIS.  A subsequent comment from Sara Shackelton, however indicates that a two-way agreement is necessary.  As such there are several issues clauses that must be included to address issues unique to underwriting insurance.  Specifically (a) confidential information supplied in order to induce AEGIS to underwrite an insurance policy must be warranted (as in any insurance application), (b) AEGIS needs the right to share such information with reinsurers (who can be held to a confidentiality agreement), and (c) if a policy is purchased AEGIS need to retain the information in case there are any enforcement disputes that might turn on the application information.  The AEGIS standard confidentiality agreement used in underwriting situations is attached.
 With regard to the revised draft of June 22nd. I note, in addition to the issues mentioned above, that the governing law provision is somewhat contradictory to the arbitration provisions and that the assumption in section 7 that confidentiality provisions will be incorporated in to the definitive agreement is usually not true for insurance policies.
 Please feel free to contact me directly (201-521-4691) to conclude this matter.
