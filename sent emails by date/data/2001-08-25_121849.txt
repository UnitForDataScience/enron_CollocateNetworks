 John,  I will be travelling on Wednesday with Mansoor to see Questar and Agave and will not be in the office to attend this meeting.  I would like to ask Lorraine Lindberg to be involved in this meeting in my absence.
 
 Lorraine, would you be available to attend this meeting for our team regarding capacity on the mainline?  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
