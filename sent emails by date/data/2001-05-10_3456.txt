 Just fyi, they're willing to take us for 20 years.
 

    
 Hi Eric,
 
 
 Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
 talking about during our phone conversation this morning.
 
 
 Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
 financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
 monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
 physical product.
 
 
 Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.
 
 
 Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
 settlement.
 
 
 
 Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes given
 month by month in MMBTU.
 
 (See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)
 
 Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please check
 if you have credit with SG for this period.
 If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
 credit.
 In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Alexander Werner
