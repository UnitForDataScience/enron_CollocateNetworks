 hey there,
 wondering what you'd like to do tonight for dinner?
 i know you probably need to do stuff like pack for germ.
 i am supremely grouchy.  i will do my best to perk up for you when i get
 home.
 i forgot shoes so i will not be joining sue at hanks.
 my plan was to go home....start drinking...and do some desk
 work/sparebedroom work.
 just shoot me a line when you get a chance...........latersky.
 Mo.
