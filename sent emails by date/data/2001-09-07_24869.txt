 Judi,
 
 Did you receive a quote for Williams yet? When I spoke with Terri she said that $5000 USD was a pretty good estimate for my move.

    Good morning Chris,
    Please find attached a Relocation Planner which outlines the estimated
    costs for your move.   I have e-mailed this to Dawn Doucet with a
    request for authorization of the additional costs above the $11,250
 
 
    Please call if you wish to discuss,
 
    Judi During
