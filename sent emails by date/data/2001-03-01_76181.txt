
 
 Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a 
 bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which 
 has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the 
 defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you 
 can see some of the definitions, etc.  
 
 One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR 
 issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is 
 exercised.  
 
 I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.  I 
 don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs.

 Hi there,
 
 Did you come up with a "form" llc agreement in conjunction with the form
 letter agreement, or is the Coral LLC agreement the latest thing?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
