    To read the articles about Auburn, Tubberville says HE made the
 decision
    they should go.  Yeah, right!  I'm sure he was told by Lowder that
    either they went or he did.  So, they were given the opportunity to
    resign, and both chose to do so.  There's already 3 or 4 candidates
 to
    replace each.  They expect to have the offensive guy in the next 2
    weeks.  Maybe a little longer for the defense.  Only remember 1
 name:
    Woody Weidenhofer from Vandy for offense.  Can't say that I've ever
    heard of the others.
 
    Oh well, we'll see how it all pans out.
 
    Thanks for the address.  I'll send the picture soon.
