 K Bargainer;


  
 
 
 I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
 that Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to
 Enron Capital and Trade Resources, Corp.
 The initials at the ECT signature block is Doug Pedigo's.
 I have always been a little confused when Karl Siverling talks about
 voiding
 an
 MOU, because I do not remember ever seeing an MOU for the Cogen Tech units.
 Perhaps we could ask Karl to send us a copy of the document he intends to
 void to make the process easier.
