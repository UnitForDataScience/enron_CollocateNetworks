 Couple of thoughts.
 
 1) If California wants to get out of this crisis, it's critical that DWR be 
 creditworthy.  Bilas' proposal helps in that regard.  We've been thinking 
 pretty hard about the issue and working with DWR to try to fix 
 creditworthiness concerns.  Christian, it might make sense to put together 
 some comments supporting Bilas' approach and perhaps give him some additional 
 recommendations about what the PUC needs to do to get DWR creditworthy? If 
 so, (see note below), we have an opportunity to provide those comments to the 
 PUC by this Friday.
 
 2) Scott Govenar while it is good, I think we
 were successful in removing the direct access suspension language from the
 ALJ's Draft Decision (it was removed in the version released on the morning
 of the last commission meeting), so I think we have that point covered
 regardless of which order gets voted out.
 
 I will fax a copy of the draft to Harry and Sue (I don't have an e-mail
 version). Let me know if you feel we should comment.
