 Mike,
 
 This morning legislative staff asked that I arrange for the appearance of an ETS security personality to address the House and Senate committees examining FL security issues. The committees tentatively plan to meet jointly on October 26th to discuss infrastructure security. There also will be a prehearing meeting on the 25th w/ committee leadership, to discuss the presentations. 
 
 The hearing schedule and agenda continues to be a work in progress as legislative members and staff prepare for a special session to begin on Monday. However, I wanted to alert you to the possibility of needing someone from your shop on at least the 26th. I have seen most everything we've produced to date regarding this issue and drafting a statement will be relatively straight forward. As is always the case, it is the committee Q and A where the practitioner is most helpful.
 
 I will keep you informed of any developments, my contact numbers are 850-350-5018 office;  850-544-6938 cell; 850-668-2782 home
