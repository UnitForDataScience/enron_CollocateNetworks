    Cc: Smith, Lou; Cohen, Louis
  The amount owed is $49,231.09.  This is almost all  on October bill for September time.  The responsible attorney in the Washington office, Sarah  Novosel  ((202) 466-9160 ; 828-3360-main), told me she had approved the  bill a couple of weeks ago.
  
 At this time, we have not received notice of  payment.
