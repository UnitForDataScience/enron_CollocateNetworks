 this bankrupcy. I have asked Linda Guinn to coordinate with you to make sure 
 Enron is doing everything we need to do.
 but it does not reflect how much is the 
 total claim.  Also, included in Debtor's 2d Amended Jt Disclosure Statement, 
 it reflects that  Class 4 Creditors consists of all Allowed Unsecured Claims 
 including ECT's claim arising from the termination of an Option (Corridor) 
 dated 5/28/99 between MPC and Enron and the Confirmation of an Option 
 (Collar) dated 11/6/98 between MPC and Enron (the "Enron Swaps").
 
 I would appreciate your help with answering the following questions:
 
 1)  Was a Proof of Claim filed on behalf of ECT and for how much?
 2)  Who is the person who will handle filing out and signing the Ballot on 
 behalf of ECT either rejecting or accepting the Plan
  [which is due to be filed on or before 7/21/00].
 3)  If we are not owed any monies by Michael Petroleum, or have not asserted 
 a claim against Michael Petroleum, then we
  can disregard sending in the ballot on behalf of ECT.     
 
 I have copies of all these documents, so if you need me to send you anything, 
 please let me know.  I appreciate your help with this and please call me if 
 any of this information is confusing.  Brenda x3-6536
