  Hope I explained it correctly. He is moving to Houston in 1-2 weeks, so he 
 must be very busy. You should call him when he gets there, I would say.

  Hi Eric,
 
 I started last Monday and this is VERY cool. It is also going to be quite a 
 challenge, as the deals are much more complex than what I had the chance to 
 see in Europe. Seems that I am going to learn a lot!! so far, expectations 
 are met.
 
  I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is 
 very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 
 1996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about 
 the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he 
 was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows 
 him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of 
 working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people 
 for your group.
 
 Have a nice trip back home.
 Fernando
