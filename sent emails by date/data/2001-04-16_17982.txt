 Anil and Carolyn want to meet.  Mark, if you want to hunker down with the 
 model tomorrow, you should feel free.  The only thing about Thursday is that 
 Carolyn's got a commitment with Dian.  Can we talk about meeting this 
 weekend?  I can be flexible.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Guys,
 
 We are not going to be able to meet during the week since we all have class
 every day of the week.  We'll have to talk on Thursday and again Sat. or
 Sun. 
 Come prepared so we can be efficient.
 
 Later
