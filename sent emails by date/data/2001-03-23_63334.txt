 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has guided and presided over the=20
 longest economic expansion in the history of the U.S.? But now, the=20
 75-year-old Greenspan faces an agonizing challenge: an abrupt economic=20
 slowdown that neither he nor anyone else fully understands. All of Greenspa=

 In short, Alan Greenspan is feeling the heat of a market in tatters and an=

 By Colin Barraclough in Buenos Aires, with bureau reports=20
 
 On Mar. 20, Argentines awoke to the news that the 54-year-old Harvard=20

 more than a decade ago was back in his old job. Cavallo is the third man to=

 hold the post of Economy Minister in as many weeks.? To win the support of=
 =20
 opposition politicians, Cavallo must take a different tack than L?pez Murph=
 y.=20
 Cavallo has already abandoned his predecessor=01,s plan to push through=20
 draconian spending cuts. Instead, he aims to narrow Argentina=01,s fiscal=
 =20
 deficit by $3 billion this year by rekindling growth, thereby boosting tax=

 Commentary by Brian Bremner in Tokyo=20
 
 On Mar. 19, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami appeared to abruptly rever=

 course by announcing measures that will effectively drive the overnight cal=

 rate back down to zero and pump up the money supply to push the consumer=20
 price index up. Markets are now abuzz with speculation that Japan will=20
 deliberately ramp up inflation past 3%, and that Hayami is a convert to the=

 cause of fast reflation. But Hayami has not given up on the other part of h=
