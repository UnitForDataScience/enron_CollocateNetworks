 site for certain users only.  There are too many people logging in that we do 
 not know.  We need to begin creating this list.  
 
 All Central, Texas, East, West, NYMEX desk and Chicago office traders 
 (Richard Tomaski will provide the Chicago office names)
 Power traders
 Fundamentals Gas, Power, EIM
 Fred's group
 Lavo, Whalley, Kitchen, Frevert,
 
 If you can think of any more let me know.  Can we implement the security this 
 week?
 
 
 
  
  
 Is it possible to deny certain users access to a site even if Everyone is the 
 blanket access for that site?
 
 Thanks,
 
 David Dronet
