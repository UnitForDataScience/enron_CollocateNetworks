 your own shot.

 Some of our people get asked on the phone about what is going on in 
 California.  I have drafted the attached paper for their use.  It is intended 
 to be simple and user-friendly.  Your thoughts on whether I achieved that 
 objectvie are welcome.  More importantly, I need you to confimr that I got 
 the story and facts correct, and that I have not said anything about the 
 situation that you (Enron USA) would not want to say, or have not said, or if 
 we have said something fundamentally different, I need to know that, too.   
 thanks for taking the time to review.  mcs
