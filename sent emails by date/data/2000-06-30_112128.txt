 Carol:
 
 We are working on the questionaire, but we have been delayed. We will have an 
 initial draft by the middle of next week.
 
 Regards
 

 
 
 Pablo and Jose:
 Could one of you e-mail me with an update of how your review of the online
 issues and documents is going and when we may be able to visit about your 
 views
 on these matters?  Thanks.
