 this?  I don't think it's necessary from a legal point of view but might 
 soften the letter a bit.

 Stacy,
 
 Can we revise the text down to the following?
 
 Dear [Customer]:
 
 Please be advised that all U.S. physical natural gas transactions that you 
 enter into with EnronOnline will be with Enron North America Corp. regardless 
 of anything to the contrary on the website or in any General Terms and 
 Conditions, if applicable.
 
 
 This leter will be sent with the User ID, so it doesn't really require much 
 of an introductory sentence.
 
 
 Dave
