 So that means you DON'T enjoy my loving ribbing?
 
 P.S. My butt still feels like there's all these rubberbands wrapped around 
 it......(:

 So you packed up our entire car and left all your stuff - what a concept.
 
 Payback is hell.
 
 
 
 and the ping pong table is
 a HUGE hit.
 
 I hope you enjoy my loving ribbing as much as I enjoy yours.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
