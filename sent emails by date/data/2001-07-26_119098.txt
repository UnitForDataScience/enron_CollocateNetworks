 SNL is an Informational Service targeted for analysis of the Financial Services Industry.  The information provides historical financial and current analysis for Financial Services companies.  SNL is the only comprehensive provider of this information that we are aware of.  Financial Trading is trading a portfolio for Financial Services and requires a relevant research tool.
 
 FACTSET is currently used.  However, FACTSET does not have the company coverage nor does it analyze financial services companies in a relevant way.  FACTSET is slanted more toward industrial firms.  
 
 The agreement is a subscription to the database for a one year term, requiring positive renewal.  The initial year term is $15,000 a year and the second year is capped at a 10% increase.
 
 We do not use this service at the current time.
