 ????????????????	Ms. Beck: 
 	
 	Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend the Enron 
 Dinner at Sullivans last Wednesday. Your enthusiasm and energy reaffirmed my 
 decision to come on board with Enron this summer. It was a pleasure meeting 
 you, and I hope we can keep in touch. I am very excited about the opportunity 
 to work at Enron, and I look forward to seeing you this summer. Thanks again. 
 	
 	Yours truly,
