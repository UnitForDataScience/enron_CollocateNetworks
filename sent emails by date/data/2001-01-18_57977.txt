 Hi Monette,
 
 Regarding the press conference on the Houston Fire Chief selection
 committee, I have only two possible dates that will work with Jeff
 Skilling's calendar. February 1 is the preferred date, anytime after
 1:30pm. Alternatively, February 2, anytime between 1:30pm and 3:30pm.
 
 Let's touch base tomorrow and try to pencil in a date for the press
 conference. Also, I don't have contact information for you...
 
 Thanks,
 
 Lisa
