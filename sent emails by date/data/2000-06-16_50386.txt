 volumes from Algeria to Elba via NB} and both AC25 and AD25 {when you start 
 incurring charter costs for the NB}).  Regarding shipping from Venezuela, you 
 could either run the volumes from Venezuela using the Newbuild or the Hoegh 
 Galleon.  I chose the Newbuild b/c its voyage costs were cheaper.  The fixed 
 costs are there regardless of which ship you choose.
 
 Shipping Voyage Costs:  The voyage costs in $/MMBtu are calculated from the 
 voyages from Algeria (for the Newbuild) and Qatar (for the Hoegh Galleon) to 
 Elba.  The Newbuild voyage costs should drop on 1/1/04 when the volumes start 
 coming from Venezuela (rather than Algeria), but they aren't currently 
 modeled that way.
 
 FOB to Qatar/Algeria/VZ:  This got a little complicated so I just plugged in 
 some fixed numbers.  $1.00/MMBtu to both Qatar and Algeria, $2.30/MMBtu to 
 Venezuela.
 
 NPV Calcs:  I've done some, but delete them if you wish.
