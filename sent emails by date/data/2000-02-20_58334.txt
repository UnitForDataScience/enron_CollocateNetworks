 she working on greenhouse gas transactions . . . or both?

 John,
 
 Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam, Paris and London - I've given the 
 contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
 thank you notes are going out today.  
 
 The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was 
 not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
 with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the "gap financing" fund.UNEP 
 conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
 Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
 quite interested in climate change business opportunities.  Also it provided 
 a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable 
 development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc.  Discussions with participants 
 in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
 working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
 interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with 
 them directly on that). I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen.
 
 Catherine
