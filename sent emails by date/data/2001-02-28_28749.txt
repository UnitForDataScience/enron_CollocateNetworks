 needs to be made, and if so when.  If a filing does not need to be made 
 immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on 
 Filing Log).
 
 - Marketer:  Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow.  
 Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and 
 (2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a 
 negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report.
 
 - Mary?  Susan?:  Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate 
 tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report.
 
 -  Mary/Glen:  Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review.  
 Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate 
 language.  Send to D.C. for filing.
 
 Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up, 
 etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all 
 other future deals without a hitch.
