 force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st.  (I'm 
 not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be).   Does that have any 
 financial consequences or other consequences for us?  For example, on TW, 
 certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, 
 right?  NN's tariff doesn't have a similar mechanism, but we may have common 
 law exposure.  We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk 
 tomorrow or Wed.  This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, 
 but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for 
 the 1st -4th were not FM.  Any thoughts?  DF

 Just an update, I notified Continental that we will not consider the 
 compressor shutins made this morning as
 Force Majeur.  They (Melissa Master) did not seem to be too surprised.  She 
 does understand
 if we go back down on the 4th or 5th we will not mark any of the compressor 
 with Force Majeure.
 Thanks for your input.  Lynn

 Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issueright?   The 
 thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
 limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
 are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
 work as good.  
 
 3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
 could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
 event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.
 
 I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF
