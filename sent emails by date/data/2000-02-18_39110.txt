 Stephen,
 
 As we discussed, it would be helpful to contact an attorney in ENA to lift 
 "invester banker" like language to insert in our initial term sheet for 
 KNOC.  The following is an approximation of what I have in mind.
 
 "If desired by KNOC and subject to prevailing market conditions, Enron will 
 use its best efforts to structure, advise, arrange, underwrite, syndicate, 
 and/or provide the capital necessary to complete the project."
 
 I'm sure the ENA guys have better language than this from some of their pitch 
 books, but hopefully you see what I'm looking for with my first cut.  From a 
 marketing perspective, we would like this to be as strong and attractive as 
 possible from a KNOC perspective, and still provide us outs to make the 
 "offer" non-binding.
 
 Cedric
