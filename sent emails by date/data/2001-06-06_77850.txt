 prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet 
 impact.  
 
 


  
  
 Probable time for them to bless the agreements; however, since these 
 documents will not be executed until after closing, the obligations created 
 under the Property Owners Association should not have a balance sheet impact.

 Greg has Christi's comments on the FPL Construction & Connection Agreement, 
 and he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we 
 engaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I'd like to have a 
 commercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance 
 to comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on 
 given his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?
 
 Please let me know. Thanks.
 
 Attached is the original generic form of FPL Connection and Construction 
 Agreement for your reference.
