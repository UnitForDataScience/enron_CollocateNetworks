 Tana,
 
 Regretfully, I will no longer be able to submit Application Access Requests 
 for you.  Until now, I have submitted e-requests on your behalf, and I feel 
 that removing myself from this process will help to reduce turn-around times 
 on your requests, as they will no longer have to come through me.  Below, I 
 have included detailed instructions on how to submit an e-request for the 
 Financial Trading Agreements Database.  Going forward, I would be glad to 
 assist you if you have any questions (on the system and on submitting 
 e-requests).  
 
 Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
 
 Regards,
 Mike 3-3363

 That would be good.  Peter.
 
 
 
   
 If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
 comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
 non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
 for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
 our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
 know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
 edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.
