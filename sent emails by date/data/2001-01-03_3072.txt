 If you are currently accessing the EOL database via Excel, Access or any 
 other means, please contact Colin Tonks (x58885).
 
 EOL intends to stop access to the data within the next month. This means that 
 any spreadsheets or Access databases will not function subsequent to this 
 change.
 
 We are currently working with EOL to attain a solution, and need your help to 
 build an inventory of all potential problems.
