 overall with the course.  Definitely one of the bestthat's what groups and compromises are all about.  After all,
 it's school.  We've made a lot of sacrifices to do it, and the point is to
 learn.
 
 Anyway, I hope you'll still comment on the presentation, and I'm glad that
 you've agreed to do part of it on Thursday.  For my part, I felt that I
 pushed yesterday about as much as I'm prepared to push and at this point,
 I'll put the ratios tables together, offer a few edits, buy don' t see much
 use going to the mat.
 
 Overall, I think it'll be an okay presentation, though getting there has
 been, well, bumpy.
 
 But thanks very much for all the work you did.  It was important, and the
 presentation is better off for it.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
