  but since they have already been applied in their merger, they may 
 also say that such conditions should be applied to all.  
 
 Joan Dreskin's comments will be very generic in opposition to rule changes 
 and WIlliams will be fairly negative.  I'm afraid they come off as a bit too 
 defensive.   So, basically the best case will likely be made by Leslie Lawner 
 of ENA.   She knows the % capacity that ENA holds on our pipes.  She is aware 
 of transactional data that is out there.  She has been briefed on the 
 Dominion merger conditions (extension of the rules of all affiliates, logs of 
 affiliate communications and visits, etc).  
 
 I know that you probably already read Jan's summary of comments.  If you are 
 interested, here are INGAA's working papers.

 Please let me know next week if there is any specific point or argument (e.g. 
 Drew's Funny Money email) that we would like to ask Joan or Leslie to 
 raise.   Otherwise, I expect that we will have the opportunity to file a 
 detailed reply after the conference.
