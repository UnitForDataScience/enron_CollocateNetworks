 > submit a work order for TW's work on this project and before I do that, I
 > need some answers on the marketing issues that we discussed on the phone
 > yesterday.  Mainly,  I need to know if I should plan on using NGPL's valve
 > for flow control, or if I should plan to install a new one.
 > 	Would it be possible to have an answer on that by the close of
 > business tomorrow?  NGPL has a required in-service date of 12-30-01 and
 > are planning to have everything ready to flow gas by 12-15-01, which
 > doesn't give us much time to get a flow control valve ordered, if one is
 > required, not to mention the Bristol.
