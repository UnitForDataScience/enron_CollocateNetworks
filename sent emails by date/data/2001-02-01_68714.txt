 Originations are not booked to the GL.  They are entered in the CS module of 
 SAP by the portfolio group.  Jim L. then incorporates them in his OA's.  
 Misti Day or Todd Warwick would be the one to contact.

 It is my understanding that the Central desk is expecting negative 
 originations to cover demand reimbursements for Natural Gas Pipeline for July 
 through September 2000.  The amount is approximately $300,000 per month.  Are 
 you aware of this and is there anything I can do to help clear this variance?
 
 Thanks,
 Cathy
