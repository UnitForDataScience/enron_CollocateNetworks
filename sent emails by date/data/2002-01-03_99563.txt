 Michael,
 
 I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.  So I apologize, I haven't been in town.  Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.  Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.  If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.  You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).  I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.  Thank you for your time.  Hope your holidays were good.
 
 Regards,
 
 Diana Scholtes
 
 


  
 
 I received your message and those times are good for me.  I will be in
 contact with you next week.
