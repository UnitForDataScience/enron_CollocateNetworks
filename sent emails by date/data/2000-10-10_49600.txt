 ACCOMMODATIONS
 
 Overnight accommodations are available at the Inn At Penn which is across
 the street from the campus (tel  215-222-0200 - mention you are here for
 the Emerging Tech conference on E-Commerce Shakeouts, to receive the
 $164/night Wharton room rate).  Please make your reservations EARLY because
 the Inn is often fully booked.    We have reserved a set of rooms for this
 event.
 
 If you stay at another hotel in Center City, most hotels (Rittenhouse,
 Latham, Ritz Carlton) are approximately 15 minutes by taxi from the campus.
 There is also a Sheraton approximately 3 blocks from the campus, on
 Chestnut St.
