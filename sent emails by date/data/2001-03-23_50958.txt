 Please, refer John directly to Jinbaek Kim and his academic advisor.

 As a followup, John Gillespie has expressed interest in participating on the 
 panel mentioned below.  To whom should I refer John or should somebody 
 contact him?  I just wanted to know what to tell John.
 
 Thanks,
 Martin

 Martin,
 
 Thanks.

 I did not find anybody in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any 
 e-procurement issues.  In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called 
 iBuyIt.  This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through 
 Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year.
 
 John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative.  Perhaps he is the 
 appropriate contact.  I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received 
 a response.

 Martin,
 
 Please, take a look at Question 3.
 Who is the right person at EBS?
