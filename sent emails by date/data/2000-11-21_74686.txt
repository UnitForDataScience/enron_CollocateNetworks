 Attached is the "term sheet" with some suggested revisions (identified by
 strikethrough and underlining).  We suggest that you simply call the "late
 charges" interest rather than any other term.  This type of business
 transaction is exempt from the usury statute in terms of any maximum rate
 and thus it is best to make it clear that the late charge is "interest"
 rather than something else.  The other changes I made were merely to
 clarify the method of calculating the interest on overdue amounts.  I note
 the the contract you provided does include a provision for interest on
 overdue invoice amounts.  Under the contract, interest is the Citibank
 prime rate.  I assume you will set this term sheet up as an amendment to
 the agreement.
