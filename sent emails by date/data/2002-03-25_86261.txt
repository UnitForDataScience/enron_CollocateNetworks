 Attached is the information that we discussed last evening.
 
 Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index.
 	The tabs that indicate "OXY II Only" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
 	The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity.
 
 If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.
