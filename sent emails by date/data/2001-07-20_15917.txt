 Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy 
 deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for 
 failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool  to build large power plants. 
 Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions 
 made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our 
 handiwork." 
 Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the 
 California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. 
 And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and 
 skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a 
 crisis: emergency powers. 
 Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested 
 it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used 
 his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the 
 bridges within 65 days. 
 South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the 
 energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- 
 blown statewide energy crisis.
