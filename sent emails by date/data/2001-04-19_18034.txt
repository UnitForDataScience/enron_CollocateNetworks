 Shelley, how detailed was the information provided?  Was it broken down by 
 shipper?  Also, did you request confidential treatment?  
 
 
 


   Paso Natural Gas Company, et al., Docket No. RP00-241-000
 
 
 FYI 
 
 Judge Wagner issued a subpoena to Transwestern and several other pipelines in 
 the referenced proceeding at SoCal Edison's request.  The request sought 
 information on scheduled, actual and contracts quantities to the California 
 border for the time period 1997 to present.  While we are not a party in the 
 case, we decided to cooperate in the proceeding and not file a motion to 
 quash.  We responded yesterday.
