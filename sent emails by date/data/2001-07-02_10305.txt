 missed his name.  I am glad he said something.  Shelley, Richard is one of the NNG/TW
 Gas Controllers and was here all weekend of the flood. Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 
 	Hi Sharon, not to complain..... but I worked the entire weekend in Gas Control during the flood. 
 
 Didn't receive gift certificate the same as the others did.
 
 									thanks, Richard
