                  Assessment
 
    All,
 
    Attached is a little more detail around the approach to refine the
    program
    plan associated with the Competitive Market Trading Assessment work.
    Please take a look and let me know if you have comments. I would like to
    begin execution of the plan next Monday when Mani Vadari and Mike
    Templin
    are in Houston.
 
    Essentially there are two tracks.
 
    1. Near Term Program Development - The first track involves reviewing
    the
    initial recommendations developed over the past weeks with the business
    and
    also confirming the near term capabilities/projects which they believe
    we
    need to focus on. The main objective here is to make sure we are in
    sync.
    with the near term business needs and are able to link the projects very
    specifically to those needs. I also want to make sure that the business
    buys into the initial recommendations and is able to articulate the
    benefits. If they don't we probably need to refine the recommendations.
 
    2. Confirm Longer Term Program - The second track is to reconcile the
    the
    longer term plan developed by the team with the near term priorities
    defined in Step 1, as well as break the longer term initiatives into
    more
    incremental components. I also wanted Mike Templin to investigate in
    more
    detail how the incremental EnPower Trading architecture migration would
    work (per Madhup's healthy scepticism).
 
    Lloyd, I wanted to make sure that Kevin is on board with this approach.
    Is
    it possible to set up a meeting tomorrow (Friday) with him to discuss
    his
    perspective?
