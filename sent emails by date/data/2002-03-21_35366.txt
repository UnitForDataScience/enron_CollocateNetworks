I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts.

 > I am in receipt of several faxes from Dominion Transmission Inc which
 inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed
 meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed
 effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some
 cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool.

 statements, we have not sent any back.  I have forwarded all of these to
 you for handling along with the many other issues between Enron, DTI,
 and the affected producers.
