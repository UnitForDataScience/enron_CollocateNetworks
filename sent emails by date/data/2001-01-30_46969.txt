 Since physical steel is a new online product, I need to know from you wheth=
 er=20
 you are aware of any reason why any existing counterparty should not be abl=
 e=20
 to trade physical steel.  From your perspective, I would consider whether=
 =20
 there is any legal reason barring a counterparty incorporated out of the US=
 =20
 from buying physical steel, or whether you are aware of any current=20
 litigation, payment disputes or other similar legal reasons which would=20
 prevent an existing counterparty from trading physical steel.
 
 Also, on a going forward basis, is there any legal impediments for any new=
 =20
 counterparties trading physical steel?

 We plan on putting two new Physical Steel product types into Production=20
 sometime next week. Jason Althaus already has the GT&Cs and will prepare th=
 em=20
 for upload when the product types are available.
 Included are final versions of the two short and long product descriptions.=
 =20
 Also included are spreadsheets detailing the location and quality=20
 combinations that will initially be shown on the Website.
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 Carl
