 7 Million over two months.

  they have all increased in value but they appear to be properly valued now.
 * The PGT capacity was sold, obviously showing no extrinsic value any longer.
 * The EPNG Perm to Valero capacity decreased in value, both in total extrinsic dollars and $/MMBtu.
 
 EAST:
 * All capacity from Rayne to Leach decreased in total extrinsic dollar value, but the $/MMBtu increased on all except the longest term Rayne to Leach deal.
 * All capacity from Onshore to Rayne increased in total dollar value, both in total and $/MMBtu.
        The net impact of these two changes was a net increase of approximately $267,000, but $/MMBtu mostly saw net increases.  
 * A new transaction on Tennessee accounted for the other $266,000 in extrinsic dollar value increase.
