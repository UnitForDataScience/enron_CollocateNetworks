 Sounds like it ought to be shared, but I haven't seen the base document.  It 
 appears, however, that sharing the info is what the USAF is encouraging, from 
 reading between the lines.  Please send me the document.
 
 Regards,
 Bill
 
 






  
 I think we ought to "share it" with folks.  Bill Gang, do you have any 
 objections?

 We can use the Air Force DA document under the Freedom of Information
 Act.  We could also distribute it to the Administration and Legislature
 anonymously.   Please advise.
