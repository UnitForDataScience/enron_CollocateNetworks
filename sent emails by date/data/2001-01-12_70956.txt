 me up a stand alone release, so that I can replace the release GE submitted 
 on some of the other turbines?
 
 Thanks,

 Will do.  I'll make the change in the remaining agreements.  Do you want
 the revised form to be included in the Fountain Valley GE and ABB
 Agreements (execution copies of which went out yesterday) or have those
 agreements already been executed?

 Pete,
 
 I have a question.  Is it necessary for the amount of consideration to
 be
 listed in the final lien form (exhibit R or S, something like that)?  If
 so, what amount goes in there?  Will this defeat what we are trying to
 do
 in keeping the original price a supposed mystery?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
