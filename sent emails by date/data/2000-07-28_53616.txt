 Eric,
 
 I have the presentation  on my laptop  and I
 shall send you the presentation in a few days when
 I get my back to my office in Houston.
 
 I am currently using the system as a guest in our Sydney office.
 
 The  person I mentioned is Anthony Dayao.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski:
 
 My name is Eric Takigawa of Algorithmics Japan, and I spoke with you on the
 last day of the seminar.
 
 I would be pleased to receive a copy of your presentation with the promise
 of non-circulating the material.
 
 I have been in communication with Mr. Jonath Whitehead and will be meeting
 Mr. Joe Hirl in early August.  You mentioned another individual at Enron
 Japan - Antonio Dai(?) but couldn't recall the proper spelling of his name
 and would like the opportunity to meet with him.
 
 There is a tremendous opportunity for Enron in Japan and the conditions are
 just right.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Eric
