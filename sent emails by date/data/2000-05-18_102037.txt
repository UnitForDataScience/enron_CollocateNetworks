                    HOROSCOPE:    Weekly 
 
 
 
                    For May 15-21: You're moving away from one
                    base of operations into another. Your
                    priorities and basic requirements are also
                    shifting. You find yourself relying less on
                    something you've clung to in the past  possibly because they're afraid of
                    being replaced. But the genie is already out
                    of the bottle, Aquarius. You can't unlearn what
                    you've already tasted. Change is rolling in on
                    its own power now. Go with it. . . and try to
                    enjoy the ride. . .
