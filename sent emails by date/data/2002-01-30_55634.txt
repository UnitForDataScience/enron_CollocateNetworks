 I would like to return the Enron equipment that I have
 to the San Francisco Office. Could you check with the
 appropriate department to whom I should give the
 equipment at the San Francisco Office. 
 
 I know that April Hrach is the Administrative
 Coordinator at the SF office and she deals with the
 equipment issues. Please ask the appropriate
 department to give me a name of a person from the SF
 office and also notify that person.
 
 Here is the equipment list:
 
 (1) Blackberry (14879) 1-877-455-1927
 (2) Laptop     (40115)
 
 Regards,
 Osman Sezgen
