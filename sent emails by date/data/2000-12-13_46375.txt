 I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex 
 A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the 
 confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch.
 
 
 


   
 
 
 I received from Derek Bailey the Confirmation Form  and the Chilean Annex, 
 but I feel there is still missing the Annex A, as it is  refferred in the 
 Confirmation Form as part of the terms and conditions of the  transaction. 
 Please confirm.
 ?
 Regards,
 Pablo Jaramillo
