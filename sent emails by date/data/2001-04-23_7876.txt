
 
 I will be out of town on Thursday.  I think that it would be great if you 
 could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear 
 how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.  If you 
 can make it, please try to attend.  And I would love to have a voice mail 
 message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.  Thanks.  
 so bring your lunch and we will 
 provide
