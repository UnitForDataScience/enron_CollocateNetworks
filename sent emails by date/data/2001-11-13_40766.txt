 I have two positions I would like to fill.  The first is a Pipe Buyer.  I have interviewed both internal and external candidates and my first choice is an external candidate.  He has excellent experience as a project buyer and solid experience in buying pipe both in mill quantities and distributor quantities.  Another fully qualified internal candidate for this position has withdrawn his application as he has decided to stay at EES.  My next choice would be an EBS buyer with good purchasing experience but no pipe experience.  There might be ramifications for bringing in a buyer with no pipe experience to replace the previous Pipe Buyer if he is eventually terminated.
 
 The second position is an expediter for the Red Rock and GTB projects.  This work is currently being handled in EEOS.  I would like to bring in Debbie Hinkle who is currently in redeployment from the Methanol Plant. 
 
 Both of this positions will be fully charged out to the projects.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
