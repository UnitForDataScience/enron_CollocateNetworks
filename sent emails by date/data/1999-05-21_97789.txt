 I wanted to make sure you are aware of this since it may be an ECT issue.  
 This is a very minor case ($60K) and the only reason Enron is a named 
 defendant is for an accounting of money paid for this disputed gas.  I am 
 trying to figure out whether this is EESI or ECT gas.  Some research so far 
 indicates that it may be neither of ours.  I will handle this for now and try 
 to get us out of this, unless you have a burning desire to deal with 
 Plaintiff's counsel in Marietta, OH.  
 
 Please give me a call at 614-791-6181 if you have any questions.  MDS
