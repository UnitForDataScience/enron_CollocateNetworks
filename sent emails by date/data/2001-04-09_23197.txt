  Project Epic.  Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.  We are also working with Marty Keyser on some potential  O & M issues at EFS.
 
 On April 17th, I will be having lunch with Michelle Cash, Sharon Butcher, Kriste Sullivan and Rick.  In the morning I will be meeting with representatives of EFS, EES and EEOS.
 
 My flight on the 17th leaves at about 5:30 pm.  Rick and I would be available to stop by your office sometime after lunch on the 17th.
 
 Please let me know if you are available to meet with us.  I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Victor Kisch
