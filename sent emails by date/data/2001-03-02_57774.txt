 Steve:
 
 Per my voicemail message to you, I have forwarded Will's resume for your 
 consideration.
 
 Thank you!

 Chris,
    Attached to this message is a copy of my resume.  A few thoughts on what 
 I would be interested in this summer:
 1)Political
 2)International
 
 These are two areas which I have pursued in the past and might like to 
 continue with in the future.  Thanks for all your help.
