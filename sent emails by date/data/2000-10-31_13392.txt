 Gary, I am going to look into this and get back to you once I have researched 
 this question.  Thanks.

 During the EDS to Enron transition I asked about getting the IT staff 
 supporting Gas Control into the random drup testing program within Enron. Per 
 the transition agreement, EDS had continued the program with an external drug 
 testing vendor after we were outsourced to EDS back in 1985. We need to get 
 our staff into the Enron internal program. Not everyone in my group is 
 effected, but most are. I've listed the names below. The Gas Control support 
 staff is framiliar with the program and aware that they are required to 
 participate. I haven't heard anything about it from anyone since the 
 transition back to Enron so I am assuming this slipped through the cracks.
 
 The staff listed below all support Gas Control, have access to the SCADA 
 systems, and could have significant impact to the operation of the 
 applications used in Gas Control to monitor and control the pipeline. 
 
 Thanks, Gary
