 Dear All,
 
 I will be leaving Enron Global Finance this Friday to join Enron Broadband 
 Services, Inc.  You should refer any inquiries in this regard to Scott 
 Sefton.  It was a pleasure working with you and I wish you great success in 
 finalyzing Margaux!  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can help you 
 with anything in the future!  All the best!
 
 Cynthia

 Donette,
 
 these questions need to be directed to the Whitewing legal team. I believe 
 this is Cynthia Harkness. I will then work with Cynthia to ensure her efforts 
 are coordinated with ours.

 As you may recall, the tax comments to the debt term sheet reflected a need 
 for an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement to admit ENA as a 
 partner. You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for 
 legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such 
 amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you 
 please consider the following:
 
 1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from 
 an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?
 
 2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?
 
 3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's 
 preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the 
 necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?
 
 4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the 
 amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance 
 legal group?  Other??
 
 Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.
 
 Kindest Regards,
 
 DMD
