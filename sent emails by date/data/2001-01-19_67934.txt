 The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
 load flag as is,
 instead of setting it to 0.

 It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
 TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.
 
 Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  
 
 Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
 flag a higher priority.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Bill
 
 
 


  
 
 The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
 production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
 to access this feature.
 
 (The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
 screen.)
 
 Thank you,

 Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
 screen Thursday morning.  
 
 Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
 production Thursday night.  
 
 Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
 trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
 everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.
