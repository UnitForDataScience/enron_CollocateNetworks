 John,
 I have been approached by HR with the following request which I would like your input.
 When an employee is being terminated HR is giving them an agreement instead of severance pay.  The question is can it be taxed by the W-4 or does it have to be taxed as supplemental pay. 
 My understanding is if an employee receives payments from an employer that are not part of their ordinary wages, it is considered supplemental wages and if the payment has been clearly indicated as other than ordinary wages it is taxed at the flat 28% (which will soon be 27.5%).
 I would appreciate your input as to whether we could set up an agreement element in the system and tax it at the W-4 rate and not have any tax issues down the road that Enron could be held accountable, and what regulation could we use for support.
 Thanks
 Janice
 
 Enron Corp.
