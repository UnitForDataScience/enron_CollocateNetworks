 Portland, and I've got a request from Kim Ward to look into this deal entered 
 incorrectly by our Short Term Southwest desk. Unfortunately, I need more 
 information, such as the deal number and term, in order to make any changes 
 to it.
 
 If you have this or know who does, please let me know and I'll be happy to 
 make any necessary changes to this deal. My number in Portland is 
 503.464.7486.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kim,
 
 The message listed below was previously forwarded to Caroline.  Per
 Caroline, I would need to talk to the actual Trader.  Please let me know if
 you can help me resolve this issue.
 Please call me at ext.  3-6488 if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Katrina

 Caroline,
 
 Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
 add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
 be changed from $5.00 to 5%.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thank You,
 Katrina
