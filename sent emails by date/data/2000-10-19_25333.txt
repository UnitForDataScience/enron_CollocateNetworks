 The UNIX Infrastructure team  would like to request downtime on system
 'aurora' this weekend.  The system has 2 faulty memory simms that we need
 to replace BEFORE they cause a problem.  We are requesting 3 hours to
 perform the memory replacement.  The following databases would be effected:
 
 eqtprod
 dcfprod
 popprod
 trdprod
 semprod
 sitprod2
 infprd53
 
 Please let me know if/when we can have time for this maintenance.
