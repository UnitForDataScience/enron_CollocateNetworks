 opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail 
 customers under most IOU tariffs.  I would ask Harold Buchanan

 I don't have any insight into this question, you may want to direct it to 
 Dave Delainey.  As I am the Treasurer, my focus is on financial activities of 
 the company.

 The following question was asked but not addressed in today's all-employee 
 meeting.  Would you please respond?  I will route to Ken, Jeff and Joe for

 Thank you.

 Energy opportunity:  Have you thought about supplying electricity to 
 railtrack for its EC4T (Electric Current for Traction), i.e. all its traction 
 power (overhead power lines and 3rd rail system).  The full idea has been 
 submitted to eMeet.
