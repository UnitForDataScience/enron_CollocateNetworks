 and transactions.  I have a November 11,1999 South African derivatives 
 questionnaire (from Webber Wentzel Bowens).  Would you like to have a copy?

 We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
 entities:
 
 Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and
 
 Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.
 
 The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
 website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
 South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.
 
 Can you take a look at this for me please?
 
 Thanks
 
 Martin
