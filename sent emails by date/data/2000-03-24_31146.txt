 Victor,
 Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company 
 are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.
 Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner, 
 in our group, will coordinate adding these locations
 for EOL trading.
 Thanks!

 Hey Jennifer,  How are you?
 
 We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new 
 pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and 
 CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG 
 North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they 
 have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers 
 are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new 
 locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the 
 benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being 
 (until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading 
 locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services 
 points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting 
 to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs 
 for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you 
 would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!
