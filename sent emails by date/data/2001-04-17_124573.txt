 Per our telephone conversation this morning, following are details on my two deals that need to be invoiced on revised schedules:
 
 
 WEIRTON STEEL CORPORATION, deal QZ2383
 
 This is a physical gas deal, running from 4/1/01 through 3/31/02.  I would like to have this invoiced on a 15-day cycle, where counterparty payment is due on the 1st of each month and the 15th of each month.  Sitara # is 693548.  We need to send them an invoice IMMEDIATELY for the first 15 days of April.
 
 
 
 IMPERIAL SUGAR COMPANY, deal QY8339
 
 This is also a physical gas, running from 4/1/01 through 6/30/01.  I want to have this invoiced on a 30-day cycle, where counterparty payment in due on May 1, June 1, and August 1.  Sitara # is 689632.
