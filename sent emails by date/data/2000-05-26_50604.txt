 June 22 works for me. Do you want to firm it up?

 Vince,
 
 Many thanks for your e-mail.
 
 >What about June 22?  I have several trips in between May 25 and June 22.
 I thank you for the invitation.  May I at this time acquire an "option" to
 visit on that date, with the finalization of the visit's timing to be
 completed early next month?
 
 Thanks and Best Regards,
 Ehud
