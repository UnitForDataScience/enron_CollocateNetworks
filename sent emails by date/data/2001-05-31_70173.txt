 Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
 via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.
 
 Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
 should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
 have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
 with Seller subject only to consent from GE).
 
 Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,
 
 Michael
