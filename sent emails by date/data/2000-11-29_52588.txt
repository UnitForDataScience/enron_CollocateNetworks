 Vince,
 
 After checking into this issue I have found that the type of information 
 requested is proprietary and not available for release.  I will try to 
 contact them and see if there is something else we can help them with but as 
 far as the data is concerned I don't believe we can help them with that 
 request.  I am sorry I couldn't be of more help.  Thank you.

 Shalesh,
 
 Please, look into it. Can we give them this information?
 I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to 
 support
 the growth of this market and part of the process is development of the
 infrastructure for this market and maintaining public interest.
