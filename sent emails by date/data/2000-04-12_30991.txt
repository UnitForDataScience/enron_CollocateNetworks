 I believe that this is metered production.  We hav a fixed price contract 
 through Aug00.

 If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).  
 If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production 
 or pool gas on CNG?
 
 
    
 	
 	

 	
 

   
 Why was this gas cut??
