 Also, how does the open season work?
 
 
 
  

    
 
 I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to
 sell.
 
 Z0 or ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter, 1,000 day for Nov-mar and
 Nov-1year.
 
 Z0 or Zl to Broad Run, 10,000 day for Nov-mar.  I think Corey showed a
 demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17.  Let me know.
 
 Thanks
