 It appears today that ETS will end the first Quarter with at least $25 Million additional dollars due to improved Revenue Margins.   This assumes that Operations will end the Quarter Flat with Plan.   If we end up under Plan, then it adds to this amount, and of course if we end up over it subtracts.
 
 It is imperative that we provide to Vera an accurate projection of where we will end this quarter, asap, but no later than Thursday of this week.
 
 Our preference would be to push as much of this $25 million into the second or third quarter.
 
 We should make every effort to project our spending for March, compare our actuals to plan for January and February and provide Vera this projection.
 
 We should also look to the outer quarters to see if we know of any major payments we have to make during these quarters and accrue for them.   We should also get with all our AP clerks and make sure that we have paid all the bills we possibly can before the end of this week, including working Saturday, if we have to.
 
 Shirley Jo - please make sure that we have properly received everything through the system that can be properly accounted for.
 
 Thanks,
