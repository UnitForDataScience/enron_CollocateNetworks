 This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project
 produced. Of course, they were free to say what they thought.
 
 Our objective is to modify the article  to such an extent that
 it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms
 in the energy industry.
 It would be only for internal consumption and it should be  a useful source of information 
 for Enron employees.
 
 
 Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.

 Vince,
 I thought this subject might make for an interesting technical corner article.  If you think it appropriate, please feel free to edit and return to me.
 
 thanks
 ken
