 John,
 
 I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
 model is to
 go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
 company.
 Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
 price of $55,000,
 in case we buy the software package.
 
 The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
 level of support.
 
 Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
 with us on Tuesday,
 November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.
 
 
 Please, let me know what you think.
 
 Vince
