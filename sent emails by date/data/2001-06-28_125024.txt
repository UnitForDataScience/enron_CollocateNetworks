 Cara,
 
 We are in the process of auditing Power Trading for ENA and were referred
 to you by Corry Bentley in regards of support for the West deals that we
 selected for testing. Due to the fact that there are no executed contracts
 for these deals, to complete our testing we need to receive 3rd party
 support (NERC Tag or 3rd party invoice) for the following West deals:
 
 Deal # 507713.1
 Deal # 528572.1
 Deal # 566541.1
 Deal # 514141.2
 Deal # 536771.2
 
 We are in the final stage or our audit, so your quick response would be
 greatly appreciated.
 
 Please call me at (713) 646-6335 if you have any questions.
 
 Thank you.
 
 Tatiana
