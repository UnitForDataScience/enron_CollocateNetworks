 Attached is the December model  which shows EAFB approx. 574 MWh short
 on Mid-Peak and 1345 MWh long on Off-Peak. I intend to monitor it every
 couple days to see how this years load compares to last year and perhaps
 we can make an adjustment accordingly. I have also attached the Hydro
 schedule I sent to WAPA and SCE. As Elliot mentioned, we will continue
 to keep you posted as developments occur here at Enron. 
 Regards,
 Jesse
