 Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even 
 though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on 
 the feverish. We know  a 
 conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel 
 sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to 
 return to its high in the coming 12 months.
 Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will 
 inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which 
 ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a 
 joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change 
 course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a 
 price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell 
 powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now 
 wants to develop a "grid parallel" system, which would work in tandem with 
 the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq 
 turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13 
 to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate 
 to get that stock back on track.
