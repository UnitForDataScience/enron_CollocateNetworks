 will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
 (and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
 Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
 courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
 credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the 
 price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
 these guys on board.
 Thanks.
