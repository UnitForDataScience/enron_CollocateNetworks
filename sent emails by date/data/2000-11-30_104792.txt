 settlement'termination in Euros.  SS

 How can the contractual currency be USD and the invoicing be in FF as 
 indicated below.  I guess I don't really care what currency is used as ECTRIC 
 will be responsible for hedging its currency risk with Hickerson; however, 
 shouldn't the contractual and termination currency be the same?
 
 
 
   
 Tanya:  Is Lee the right person to approve this change for SITA?  Remember, 
 SITA is acutally with ECTRIC (nto ENA) and SITA wanted to settle in Euros.  
 Thanks.  Sara

 Tanya:
 
 SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
 Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
 Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
 agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
 confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
 the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).
 
 What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.
