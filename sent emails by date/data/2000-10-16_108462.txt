 Shelly:
  Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
 Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
 the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
 program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
 I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
 Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
 can think outside the box.
 
 Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
 instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
 left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
 consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
 grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
 swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
 develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
 demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
 attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
 Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
 in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
 Global Markets upon her graduation.
 
 If you need any further information, please let me know.
 
 Thank you for your assistance with this matter.
