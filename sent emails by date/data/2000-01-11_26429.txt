 (ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been 
 zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I 
 need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.  But, I want to make sure 
 that is what we need to do.

 Could you please setup a spot deal for October under ICC Energy Corp.  I 
 would just copy the TXU deal below.  I believe the pricing is the same.

 Howard,
 
 Please forward to the appropriate v.m. person in your group.  Thanks.
 
 10,000 mmbtu scheduled on October 14th should be moved from Sitara deal 
 #120941 (TXU Fuel Company) to Sitara deal #131478 (ICC Energy Corporation) on 
 OPLC Meter 1527.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks for your help.
