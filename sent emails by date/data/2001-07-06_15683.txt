 WASHINGTON encouragement of conservation, some exploration, 
 but everything is environmentally friendly." 
 The White House already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies. 
 Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable 
 energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He also has paid more 
 attention to energy conservation, indicating support for spending on 
 efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget. 
 But the president is not backing away from his position that the United 
 States needs to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House 
 officials say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. 
 The energy plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in 
 the Alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to 
 pay for research into alternative energy sources. 
 In addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and 
 energy, the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially 
 accompanied his energy proposals. Rolling blackouts in California are on the 
 wane, gasoline prices are falling and last week John Browne, the chief 
 executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call for new oil refineries. 
 That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president 
 without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions. 
 "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at 
 the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Like the patients' bill 
 of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, energy right now "is 
 low-hanging fruit," he said.
