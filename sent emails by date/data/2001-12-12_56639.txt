 Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the r=
 ichly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created amon=
 g members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to "people" =
 issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse=
  team environment.  =20
 I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like =
 to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and shar=
 e learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron iss=
 ues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with y=
 ou and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be app=
 roved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed a=
 nd approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive=
  any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing=
  the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, pre=
 viously-published works I've done. =20
 I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  =
 On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture t=
 he wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you ha=
 ve interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with m=
 e further in the next couple of days?
 Respectfully,=20
