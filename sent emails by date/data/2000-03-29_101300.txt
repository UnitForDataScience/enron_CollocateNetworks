 As you may be aware, SoCalGas is going through Gas Industry Restructuring.? 
 One of our settlement proposals is to provide pooling service.? We have been 
 asked to compare our estimate for cost and development time with others who 
 have implemented pooling service on their system.? Therefore, if you have a 
 ballpark figure of the cost incurred to develop pooling and approximately how 
 long it took to build from the time you provided requirements to your 
 implementation date, we would appreciate it very much.? If you have any 
 questions, you can e-mail me or call me at (213) 24r-3812.
