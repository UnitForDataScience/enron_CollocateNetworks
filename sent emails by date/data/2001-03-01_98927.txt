 >  C.  DWR's Motion to Dismiss 3rd Party Complaint
 
  Reliant brought a third party complaint against DWR, and DWR moved
 to dismiss.  As framed by the Court, the key issue is:  does 11th Amendment
 prohibit Reliant from joining DWR in the case?  Judge Damrell asked about
 the 11th Amendment immunity argument, stating that the issue was not
 thoroughly briefed.  The Judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefs
 on the issue.
 
  I am obtaining a copy of these supplemental briefs and I will
 summarize DWR's argument in a subsequent email.
