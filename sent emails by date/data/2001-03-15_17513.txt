 Air Force in California.  I've participated in weekly calls with them in the 
 effort to get them energized about DA.  Turns out they're precluded by law 
 from lobbying.  But they seem to have other ways of being influential.  I've 
 put Scott Govenar in contact with them and he's keeping them in the DA 
 Coalition loop.  Bill/Scott is this guy familiar to you?  Bill any 
 suggestions on how we might best target them in our efforts to get groups 
 energized?  Bill:  Perhaps you could phone Janel Guerrero directly to 
 discuss?  Her number is:  713.853.9104 (is that right Janel)?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I think a Ken letter is a great idea.  I'll ask him about participating in 
 the Coalition.

 This is great Sue.  I would like to loop him into our non-business target 
 with a letter from Ken.  Do you also see them having a role in the Direct 
 Access Coaltion?  I'll let you work that end.

 let's see how we can use this guy.  He is already communicating with Scott 
 Governor

 Attached, please find the proposed amendments to SBX 27 (Bowen) relating

 call tomorrow to discuss current events as well as the new language.
