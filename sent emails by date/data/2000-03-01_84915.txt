 create for Ginger and use for this interconnect.  Let's discuss when we get a 
 chance.

 Per Billy Sheilds at Tejas, the cost for a 3" meter and tap is $ 27,000. The 
 estimate does not
 include separation, regulation or site with fencing which Tejas is expecting 
 HPL to provide.
 To proceed, the field people need to meet and agree upon the details, and a 
 contract needs
 to be entered into for all gas delivered from Tejas to HPL at this point. All 
 cost incurred for
  the meter installation is reimbursable to Tejas.
