 report.  My "assumption" in my message was wishful thinking and not 
 conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and AA had occurred.  
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

   
 Sally,
 
 Thank you for the copy.  Contrary to your assumption, this is the first 
 Kristin or I have seen the draft.  I'm sure Kristin will discuss it with you 
 and her displeasure with AA.  
 
 Thanks,
 Leslie

 Attached are the results of our East Power review.  Although some of the 
 identified areas for improvement are outside the responsibility of East 
 Power, we wanted to bring these items to the attention of management for 
 their consideration.  
 
 There is no planned Monthly Audit Meeting to discuss this report as we have 
 done in the past; therefore, if you have any questions or comments and would 
 like to set up a meeting with either of us, please feel free to contact us. 
 
 Thank you
