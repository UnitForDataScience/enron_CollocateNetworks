
 
   a Limited Day is defined as 
 a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
 the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
 gas is transported.  
 
 Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
 first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
 the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
 so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
 you think.
