  Below is the notification that I sent to Bob Bowen on 12/22 to let the 
 confirm group know about the transaction agreement which has been signed by 
 the customer.  I talked with Craig Breslau this afternoon and he said he 
 would sign in behalf of ENA and sent to me asap.  As soon as I get the signed 
 agreements, I will sent the confirm to Ellen Wallumrod and the contract to 
 Cyndie Balfour-Flangan.  Any questions?

 Dan,
 
 On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
 attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
 read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
 Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
 executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  
 
 I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
 red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
 that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
 could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
 been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.
 
 Regards,
