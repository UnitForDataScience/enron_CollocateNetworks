
 
 David,
 
 I am leaving for vacation this weekend and I haven't received the copy of 
 your presentation yet.
 The window during which I could make changes to my presentation is closing 
 very fast. Let's
 do the following: I shall keep my presentation as is (this means that I shall 
 use the copy of my 
 presentation I sent to Dawn Scovill  and you this week). If there is an 
 overlap between our presentations, so be it.
 
 Dawn, please use the copy of my presentation I sent you earlier this week.
 
 Vince
