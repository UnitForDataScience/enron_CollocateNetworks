 Team,
 
 Please find my comments in the word document attached. 
 
 Please go through this and run the sensitivities and get a good idea of way 
 to structure thsi.  Having gone through the comments, I feel that it maybe 
 necessary to get some help on the structuring side.  I will try to get you 
 some structuring expertise asap.  In the mean time, I would like you all to 
 focus on getting resources together and working this to the next pass.
 
 Lets see where we can get with this.
 
 Regards,
 Sandeep.

 As discussed, please find enclosed  a word document which essentially 
 discusses most of the issues involved with a Firm Power sale of 50 MW from 
 Phase I, which would have to be sorted out with MSEB. 
 
 Vivek & I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this 
 firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep 
 the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to 
 the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation; 
 will put the tariff formula in the next mail)
 
 The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement, 
 before we discuss it with MSEB.
 
 Looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff 
 computation.
 
 
 
 
 regards,
 
 Rajesh S
