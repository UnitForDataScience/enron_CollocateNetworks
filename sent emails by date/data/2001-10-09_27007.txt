 I think that this company falls into your group now.  Sorry about passing the buck.  Would the tax department be responsible for registering a company to do business in a state?  Wouldn't corporate secretary be responsible for registering a company in a state?  Let me know how this turns out for future questions.

 Mary.  I have more information on the status of this entity with the state of Oklahoma.  The State did acknowledge receiving the documents for which you sent the evidence to me yesterday.  However, they indicate that the $15 reinstatement fee was not paid, nor was the initial business registration booklet filed.  We will remain suspended until those documents are filed.  
 
 Lynda - I think that you might be the one who would handle the initial business registration booklet, but I am not sure.  If neither you nor Mary are the appropriate ones to contact about these matters, will you please advise who is.
 
 It would also be a good idea that when those documents are ready to be filed that a copy of the cancelled check, front and back, that accompanied the documents you sent in August be attached with an explanatory cover letter so the state can put all the pieces back together.  If you would like to pass the completed documents through me for filing, I will be happy to take care of getting them to NRAI for filing.
 If you believe that these documents have been filed and that we should be in good standing, you may want to contact the State directly at 405 521-3161. 
 Please let me know your thoughts on this.
