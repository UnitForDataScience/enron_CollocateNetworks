 useful to carpool

 
  
 
 Hi Team,
 
 Here's the final cut. 
 
 I added hyperlinks to DCF sheets in backup as well as to 
 trading comps and deal comps in the backup. And animation
 for slide turns. 
 
 Also, be sure to preview the 3-legged stool slide I added 
 after valuations in slide presentation mode with sound 
 enabled... Totally OK to remove it if any of you don't like 
 it...

 Any Qs, call me on my cell: 916 600 1245.
