 liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).  There are some 
 legal considerations with respect to certain products.  In order to trade any 
 financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible 
 swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) 
 and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.  Otherwise, 
 we have no problem with limited liability companies.

 Dear Mrs. Gardiner,
 
 Thank you very much for your message dated November 6, 2000.  Given the
 present legal constraints concerning companies incorporated in Liberia,
 would EnronOnline consider an application by a Limited Liability Company
 organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut?  If yes would you
 please provide the relevant documentation for such entity?
 
 I am looking forward to hearing from you.
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Lambros Papaeconomou, Director
 New York Freight Exchange, Inc.

 PS.  I will be in London on Thursday November 9 and have an appointment to
 meet with Andy James of Enron Shipping at 3PM.  Should you be available
 before or after my appointment, I would very much appreciate to meet you in
 person and further discuss the requirements for opening a trading account
 with EnronOnline (beyond the company jurisdiction requirement which I hope
 would now be solved!)
