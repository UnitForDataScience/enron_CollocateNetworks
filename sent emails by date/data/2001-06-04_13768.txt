 Attached please find termination letter that you requested.  Please note
 that it is set up to be signed by Enron, as required by the original
 assignment letter, and acknowledged by Hanover Measurement Services and Mr.
 Rome.  In addition, I have attached resolutions of the Hanover Measurement
 which authorize the termination of Mr. Rome's assignment to the Company.
 
 Please call me with any comments or questions you may have.
