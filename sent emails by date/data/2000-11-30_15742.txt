 Jeff-
 I think their predictions are correct about members getting active part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come
 to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the
 Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you
 folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks
 pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I
 wanted to share.
 
 Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
