 Hey,
 
 Phillip already made reservations and Jeff is waiting to make sure he can go.  Darren and his wife have made their plans, and Dawn and Gary have also, I think.  I will next week, and a couple other girls from risk are going too.  We're leaving on the 13th, returning the 16th.  Staying at the Mirage. 
 
 You could win thousands in Vegas to use for your house.  What other vacation can do that.
 
 Well, we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for now.  I'm sure it will be next week though.  We're assuming it will happen and have been setting up all new files and databases.  It should be interesting.
 
 How is your job?  Does Kyle Lilly work for you now?
 
 Later,
 Kam
 
 
 

 





  
 
 Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
 the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
 people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
 sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
 back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
 somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
 maybe we can get some drinks.
 
 Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
 that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
 good chance for an informal interview.
 
 Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
 missed.
 
 Kyle
