
 
 Thanks was on law review, people who worked with her love
 her, but she just wants a part time gig since she is a mom with kid
 responsibilities.
 
 She wants to work part-time (20-24 hours/week) preferably employment litigation, but commercial litigation would work too.
 
 If you have need or know of someone who does, let me know and I'll get her resume for you.
 
 thanks
