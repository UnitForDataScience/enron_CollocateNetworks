
 
  one that supposedly shows "outrageously excessive profits
 by traders."  It would appear that we have the wrong chart.  The missing
 chart is also the one referred to in Chairman Hoecker's questions to Enron.
 Could you try again to locate this profit chart and get it to us as soon as
 possible.  We need it to evaluate the proposed responses.
 
 Thanks
 Gary
