 not shutting down the business.   We have a great team assembled and I think 
 it will calm down the traders in EWS.  I will keep you posted.

 Mark, I appreciate your help in these matters.  We need to be accurate and 
 manage our risk but we can't "land the plane" or kill current and future deal 
 velocity in the process.  Let me know how I can help.
 
 Thanks much
 Dave
