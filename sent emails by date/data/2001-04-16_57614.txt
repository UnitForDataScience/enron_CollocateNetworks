 The recent plan filed at FERC is horrible.  The two most aggregious parts are 
 the cost based standing bids and the ban on exports.  I know that we are 
 commenting on this proposal.  I am also looking for intellegence on whether 
 the ISO proposal has any chance of getting approved by FERC.  If it is not 
 approved by FERC, what can the Californians do?  California has ignored FERC 
 before.  If they attempt to unilaterally implement changes what is the 
 likelihood that the Feds step in to intervene?  If you hear anything on this 
 matter please keep me posted.  The proposed plan will have a huge impact on 
 the California market and we need as much advance notice as possible.
