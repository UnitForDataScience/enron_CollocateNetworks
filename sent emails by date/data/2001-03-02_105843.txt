 Joe-  a few things regading the POA/ Cargill line..
 
 I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you
 probably already have this.  We should allocate a piece to Global which
 would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting
 us
 over the limit, without me knowing...
 
 We could change the language of the POA to this... we will not go over
 Global's piece of the Cargill line...I think this would solve our main
 concern...
 
 Please let me know... we are eager to keep trading with Global and
 yourselves...
 
 Regards,
 Caroline
