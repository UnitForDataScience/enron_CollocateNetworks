If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.
 
 Take care

 Dear Friends,
 
 I realize that some of you may no longer be at Enron.  I am very sorry about
 what has happened and wish you all the best for a pleasant and productive
 2002.  I need to make you aware of a situation that makes me very nervous.
 
 We have been contacted by Nominet, the Registry for .UK domains.  Nominet
 has asked us to free the domain ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK and allow it to transfer
 away to a third party: Centrica Plc
 
 Please advise whether we should follow these instructions at your earliest
 (most urgent) opportunity.
 
 Furthermore, if you have a moment, call me in order to sort out some open
 domain matters.
 
 Best regards,
 Josh
