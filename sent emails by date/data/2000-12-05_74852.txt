 Hi,
 
 You must be busy these days.  I remember this time of year - and I don't
 really miss it.  Cleaning and exercising were my favorite procrastination
 activities.
 
 Neil and I would like to schedule a brief Neil and Kay vacation over the
 holidays.  We are looking at December 27-30, so we would be back before New
 Year's Eve.  We will pay you handsomely (in cash!!!) for keeping Michael
 for those days/nights.  What do you think?  We have found a room at the Inn
 Above Onion Creek.  I know Michael would be so excited to spend the time
 with you. We can give you guys a generous allowance to make things easier,
 and you can drive the Lexus.
 
 Do I sound like I'm begging yet?  I'm working really hard these days, and a
 few days of no responsibilities sounds GREAT.
 
 You should start watching your box at the end of the week.  Hope it gets
 there before Saturday, since I know the SU post office is closed.
 
 Love,
 
 Mom
