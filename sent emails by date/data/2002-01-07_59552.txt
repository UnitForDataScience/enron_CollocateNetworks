 Suzanne,
 
 Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.
