 You will not receive a paper receipt, itinerary, or confirmation letter 
 automatically.
 We suggest you keep a copy of this e-mail or print a copy of your itinerary 
 for
 your records; it may also be useful when you check in at the airport.
 
 When you arrive at the airport on the day of your flight(s), give the
 ticket agent your last name, flight number and a government-issued photo
 identification to receive your boarding pass(es).
 
 Airlines require government-issued photo identification upon check-in,
 such as a driver's license or passport. For questions concerning this
 requirement, please contact the airline.
 
 A valid passport is required for international travel. Some countries
 also have visa and/or health requirements. Please check with the embassy
 of the country to which you are traveling or consult Expedia.com's World
