 Laura:
 If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour 
 briefing you on the energy situation.  I apologize for the brevity of this 
 note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.
 
 In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underwayconsumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large 
 industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market.
 NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility 
 transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal).
 Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers.
 Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc.
 
 Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of "wise 
 persons" to help get the deal done.  L. Summers is willing; others are being 
 considered.  Your name has come up.  But that issue can be addressed later.  
 The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events, 
 which are breaking quickly.
 
 Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.  Congratulations on Haas' #7 
 ranking in US News and World Report.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
