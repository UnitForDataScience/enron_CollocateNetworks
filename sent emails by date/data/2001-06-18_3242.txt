 Two Energy Auctions in End Jan-Beg Feb:
 In the last week, it has been announced that the CDWR (California
 Department of Water Resources) will not honor the Bids resulting from the
 two auctions held this year.  Out of the 31 contracts, only 8 have been
 signed.  The other 23 are expected to either remain unsigned/uncontracted
 or their terms (their prices) are expected to change since power prices
 have decreased so much since the beginning of the year.
 
 John- have we seen any selling in the 10 year curve to support the
 above..all the people who bought in Jan and Feb selling out???
