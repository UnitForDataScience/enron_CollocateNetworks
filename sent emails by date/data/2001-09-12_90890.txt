
 
 I would still like to play golf this weekend b/c it is the friendship that is fun
 I might even take on Ernesto for the Brock dog challenge
 
 It is truly sick what happened , I was talking to a broker that was in the second world trade tower as it got
 hit and he was describing what was going on.  Several people I know made it out of both buildings but many are not 
 yet accounted for , so at this time all there is is hope.
 
 May everyone have a peaceful day
 
 Dutch
