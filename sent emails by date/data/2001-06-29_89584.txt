  Phil. 4:13 
 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, 
 that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life." 
 If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you 
 can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also. 
 My "People I shared the gospel with" file just got bigger, 
 how about yours?
