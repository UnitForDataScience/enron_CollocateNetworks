 We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very 
 inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting 
 with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry 
 relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships 
 throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our 
 own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am 
 waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient.
 
 The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I 
 will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles 
 and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will 
 price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.
