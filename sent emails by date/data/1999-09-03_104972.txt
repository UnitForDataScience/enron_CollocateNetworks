 marked the doc for accuracy (as far as I can tell) but I don't know if the 
 general statements are accurate.  Please coordinate through Tana Jones.  I do 
 not know who wrote the document, but I presume it was someone in London.  Sara

 Steven & Carol,
 
 I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
 site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
 will be trading on the system to give users some general information.
 
 I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
 in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
 descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.
 
 In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
 below.
 
 Canada Gas
 LPG
 NOx Emissions
 Oil & Oil products
 Plastics and Petrochemicals
 Pulp & Paper
 SO2 Emissions
 US Coal
 US Natural Gas
 US East Power
 US West Power
 Weather Derivatives
 
 I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
 the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
 appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
 have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  
 
 Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
 tomorrow.
 
 
 
 If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.
 
 Thanks
 
 Awais
