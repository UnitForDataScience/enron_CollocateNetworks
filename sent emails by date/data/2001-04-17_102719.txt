 Mike,
 
 I see in your emails below that you are indicating that the allocation proc=
 ess does not comply with the tariff. The allocation process I do not think =
 is the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the =
 only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari=
 ff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t=
 he range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that =
 way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation=
  process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it=
  looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates ar=
 e found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that T=
 W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra=
 tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis & load the total specific contract=
  deal rate in CBS.  Please let me know if there are other problems in the a=
 llocation process itself.
 
 Thanks Ramona
   who gets prior=
 ity?
 
 =09Answer:  Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest tota=
 l cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff.
