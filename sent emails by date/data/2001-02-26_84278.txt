 Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281) 772-9250.  
 If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't you just 
 call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll ride 
 over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing with me.  My 
 latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The wedding is at 7.
 
 Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

 Gerald,
 
 Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129 rate.  Below
 you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it matters which
 one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.  They're both on
 my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.
 
 I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from SA.  I
 estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00 right?)  We'll
 actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family from the
 Valley will be there as well.
 
 If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at the hotel
 sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding together 
 from
 there.
 
 In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got him a gift
 yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.
