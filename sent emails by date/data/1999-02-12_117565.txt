 Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.

 Mark,
 
 I really have no idea what this is all about, but it seems to be spiralling a 
 bit out of control.  I'm in NYC today, but could you call Ms Arteaga and sort 
 this out?  Let me know if I need to do anything.
 
 Thanks,
 Randy

 Brent works for ECT legal, not EI.  He reports to Mark Taylor, an AGC in ECT 
 Legal.

 Randy/ Scott:
 
 I don't know if you remember or not, but last year I had a question as to who 
 Brent would report to and who's budget it should hit.
 He's now in Scott rc but he's a Sr. Counsel.  Shouldn't he be in Randy's rc? 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks,
 Karen
