 Jim,
 
 I shall contact Althea and make sure Rusty meets with the Research Group
 members.

 Vince, I am quite grateful. Thanks for arranging this.
 
 By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus this spring before school lets out?  If not, let's definitely plan on scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jim Garven
