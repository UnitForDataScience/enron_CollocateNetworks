 this morning it would not be possible to come up  with firm numbers for the
 system by Friday. Do you need firm proposal or budget  pricing?
 Further, Water Control Associates (WCA) would offer  an alternate side
 stream system to that specified.
 It would not make sense to supply tanks piping etc  from US sources for a
 project in Italy. What  Water Control Associates could do is create the
 design and specify the equipment  required to be primarily sourced in
 Europe. For a cooling tower project in Chile  for Kvaerner (Vancouver) we
 did just that, where some equipment bought by  Kvaerner came from USA and
 other materials locally in Chile. WCA have a system  operating in Turkey.
 Please refer the web page www.uswca.com.
 Before we can go any further, please  reply.
 Thank You
