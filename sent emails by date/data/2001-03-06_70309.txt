 I think we should do a phone conference to resolve the outstanding issues 
 regarding the engagement of "local lobbying firms" by ENA.  I will schedule a 
 call for tomorrow at 10:30am (cst).  Please advise if that time works with 
 your schedule.  Thanks.

 It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our 
 discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as 
 an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors.
 
 I look forward to speaking with you soon.
