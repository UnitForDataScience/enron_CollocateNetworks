 Terry,
 
 Per a vxmail I received from Steve Kean, Jeff Gray is no longer needed in his current rotation in Steve's group.  Steve recommends he be considered for other opportunities that may be available within the company.  Please make the appropriate notations within our spreadsheets.
 
 Thanks,
 Billy
