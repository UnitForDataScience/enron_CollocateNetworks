 able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
 than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  
 
 In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
 that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
 necessary.
 
  New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
 manager.
  New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
 of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
   Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
 are looking for will appear.
 
 I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
 takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
 updates its information
