 its going well, thanks for asking - work is good - i'm getting excited to start trading again and i'm actually doing some real work!  feels good.  and i'm having fun with the whole exercise thing - i hope it sticks.  how are things with you - i know you are super busy, but it must be good to finally be starting a career?  
 
 rockne is a special treat.  at least he isn't hairy.  i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life.  
 
 i'm not excited to move at all, but i am looking forward to living in a new spot.  change is good.  i probly won't need your help moving, but i am planning on lifting some of those shelves from ikea, so i'll be sure to give you a ring for the install.  
 
 great to see you last night at banana.  i can't wait to wear my blue pants, but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule, so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day.  definitely a good purchase, since i'll probably wear them twice (total).  
 
 hope to see you tonight.

    eze-  i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight.  i went to 
 core last night and it was nice and mellow.  do you have any idea who 
 teaches the 7:30 class?  i went a while back and it this hyper-active guy 
 taught the class and it wasn't so good - adding that to the rockne risk 
 makes it a dangerious proposition. 
 do you happen to have janice's email address?  jai and i haven't been to 
 earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing.  if you see her 
 when you're working, tell her i said hi.
