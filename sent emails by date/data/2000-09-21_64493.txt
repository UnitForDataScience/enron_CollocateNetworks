 Anyway, on to more positive stuff.... I have decided to put myself through
 this one more time (no Winter league for me!), but I need your help.
 Please let me know the following...
 
      - if you are interested in playing full-time in the Tuesday night Fall
 coed league that will begin Oct. 3rd
 or
      - if you are only interested in being a sub
 
 Remember, the cost of the team is fixed and each person's share is
 determined by the number of people paying, so please only commit if you
 will be coming out to play (and pay).
 
 Please reply by next WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27th.  I will not assume that you
 want to play unless you send me a confirmation email.
 
 Thanks,
 Roy
