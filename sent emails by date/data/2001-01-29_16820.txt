 Assemblyman Joe Nation put a bill in the hopper Friday, January 26th, which 
 he believes is congruent with our thinking (see attached).? He is seeking our 
 comments and possible endorsements.
 

 let me know whether you believe we should work with him and consider 
 endorsing his bill.
 
 Thanks,
 David Teece
