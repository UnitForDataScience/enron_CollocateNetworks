 Please set up a lunch meeting with Mike Roberts and myself and Jose Molina

 Vince,
 
 Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...
 
 I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.
 
 I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.
 
 Let me know.
 
 Regards,
 
 Laura Luce
