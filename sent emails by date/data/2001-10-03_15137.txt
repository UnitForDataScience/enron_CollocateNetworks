 You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe=
 ad DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would =
 mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART off=
 peak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.
 
  it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
 d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
 L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
 r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
 thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
 ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
 ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
 tion.
 
 Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
 ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
 ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
 t language and EOL mechanics.
 
 Thanks.
