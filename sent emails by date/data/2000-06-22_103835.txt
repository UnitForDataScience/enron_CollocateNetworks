 Genia,
 
 Attached please find a credit worksheet containing terms for an EEI Master 
 Power Agreement between New England Power Company and EPMI.  Please note that 
 S&P does not provide a credit rating for senior, unsecured debt, therefore, I 
 am electing to use the "long-term credit rating" by S&P and senior, unsecured 
 debt to apply to Moody's.  Please see the cws for the color allocation.
 
 I am available should you have any questions, x3-0554.
 
 Regards,
 Tracy
