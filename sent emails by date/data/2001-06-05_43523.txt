 Debbie is meeting with her attorney on Friday regarding the post marital
 agreement modification.  I do not think it is much of an issue so we
 should get revision executed very soon.
 
 I have gone through the Agreement again and they look fine.  My notes
 indicate only the following changes need to be made:
 
 1.  Caron's portion of the inheritance if I die first should be the
 lesser of 5% or $3million and she pays the tax due;
 
 2.  The house I own at 9302 Cypresswood Drive together with all
 furnishings etc would be left to Debbie instead of the marital trust;
 and,
 
 3. J> P> Morgan/Chase Bank would be an alternate to MSDW as trustee.
 
 What is the next step?
