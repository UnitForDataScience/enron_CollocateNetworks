 I really have no interest in Lewis River or Klamath since there is zero correlation to the Columbia flows....  However, I'll offer the whole deal at $3 million per year with the hair if they're insistent.  Or we'll do any power options the weather desk wants.

 How is the pricing for the stream flow going?
 
 Please let me know,
