 grand-standing politicians (who seem to have an abundance of rhetoric and 
 capacity for scape-goating, and a paucity of constructive solutions or the 
 will necessary to do what needs to be done), seems worth considering the pros 
 and cons of throwing anyone in front of any legislative committees.  We may 
 decide that the pros outweigh the cons and that there's discernable value 
 having our outside counsel speak to the issues of supply and demand in 
 California and the West, but seems worth spending 5 or 10 minutes on.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 There will be an oversight subcommittee of the new committee formed to
 shape energy policy in the Special Session.  In a meeting today,
 Assembly Member Darryl Steinberg, who will Chair the subcommittee, told
 us he expects to hold two hearings to "track the money" between
 utilities, geneators and wholesalers.  He hopes to wait until after the
 completion of the PUC audit, unless that audit drags on longer than the
 next week or so.  He is planning a "constructive investigation" and
 pledges to be fair.  The subcommttee will be staffed by the Speakers
 Office of Oversight.
 
 Also, Enron has been invited to testify at an informational hearing of
 the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee on January 16, 2001.  The
 general topiic is how supply and demand affect the California market and
 what options are available for new or repowered generation in
 California.
