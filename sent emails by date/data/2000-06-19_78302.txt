 I'm happy to take care of this, I just want to make sure I'm not stepping on 
 anyone's toes. Is anyone else working on this?

 Brian,
 
 Attached please review and advise acceptance for the revised draft LOC. We
 have eliminated the effective date being subject to receipt of final
 payment. Hopefully this draft LOC is acceptable. If so, Braden could issue
 the formal LOC early next week.
 
 Regards, Curt
