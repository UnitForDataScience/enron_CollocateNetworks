 I am requesting that the Legal Department draft and approve specific language that the Mid-Marketing groups can utilize in proposals and subsequent contracts to address the issue of RTO development and the impact on the risk profiles of our commercial transactions.
 
 As deal flow and longer term deals continue to increase, the issue of RTO development is having a pronounced impact on quantfying the risk the trading desk is willing to assume along with the pricing to be offered on particular transactions.
 
 While it would be imprudent to avoid long term deals with primary terms that extend over the development timeline of the RTO's, we need to immediately begin to address this issue in our proposals and subsequent deal confirmations.
 
 The Mid-Marketing Team would like to have generic language that we can begin using by 8/10/01. 
 
 
 Thanks 
 
 Oscar
