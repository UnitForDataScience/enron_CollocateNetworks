 I'm leaving on vacation after tomorrow for 2 1/2 weeks and there's no way I 
 can get to this before I leave.  Would you please handle this for me in the 
 interim?  If not, please talk to Kay about who could handle this for Greg in 
 my absence.  It may just need to go to outside counsel.
 
 Thanks!
