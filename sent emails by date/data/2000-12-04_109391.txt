 I'm writing on behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling in response to your e-mail below.  
 
 Mr. Skilling is very interested in meeting with Sr. Rafael Miranda.  
 Unfortunately, he does not have any planned trips to Europe within the next 
 couple of months, though that may change after the first of the year.  If, 
 however, Sr. Miranda has any plans to be stateside, I would be happy to 
 arrange a time for the two of them to meet.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
 Regards,
 Sherri Sera
 Assistant to Jeff Skilling
