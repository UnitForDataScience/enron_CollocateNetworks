 Thank you so much for your kind thoughts.  I sure have enjoyed working with everyone.  I will miss all the great personalities that we have assembled in ETS!  And, you can definitely count on me for being at The Nutcracker!
 
 Thanks again, Kim  :>)
 
   hope to see you around at least The Nutcracker!!
 
 Best regards,
 Sherry
