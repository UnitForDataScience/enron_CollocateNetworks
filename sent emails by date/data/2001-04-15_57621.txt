 so quickly.  Yes, I'd be willing to relocate.  I'm more interested in how
 challenging the work would/could be (and the level of pay) then where I am
 physically located.  Attached is my resume.  Feel free to send it to the
 headhunter who called you and/or to anyone you think might be interested at
 Enron.  Jennifer
 
 PS  I had never talked to Schaefer before the Boise meeting.  He was not
 very impressive and I agree with your assessment that you will not be able
 to persuade him on the price cap issue.
