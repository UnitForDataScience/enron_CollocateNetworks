
 
 We should value the project.   A combined cycle in Eastern NY may make sense.
 
  

 
  
 Please respond to Dan, 
 
 
 We would like to speak to someone about the sale/purchace of the Glenville 
 Project, a 520 MW gas-fired, combined cycle project located in the Capital 
 District of NY. Who would we contact? 
 
 The project has continued to be funded by GE Power Systems and is at a point 
 where, according to their plan, permanent equity would enter into the 
 project. The project is filing its Article 10 application after having 
 invested substantial money and resources. The permit issuance looks good, 
 energy pricing has held up well, and this project will be part of the first 
 group to be licenced. 
 
 
 Best Regards,
