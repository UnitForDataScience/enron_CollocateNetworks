 Rebox, whoever is technically responsible is highly accountable to ensure 
 that reporting and procedures are correctly followed and that the project 
 comes in on time, budget and technically works.   In this capacity, I would 
 like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays.

 Nick-
 
 Per our conversation, Ward Polzin from the Producer Finance Group mentioned 
 that during their presentation to Dave Delaney with Ray Bowen-VP Commercial 
 and Scott Josey, the subject of who would do the project management for Enron 
 came up.  Ward said my name was mentioned and that Ray Bowen said that if I 
 couldn't he knew of a group from Power that did Project Management.
 
 I would highly recommend you step in quickly offering our services before the 
 decision is made to use someone else.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Audrey
