   While most of the ads were not particularly negative, others
 used sarcasm or debatable statistics to attack their targets.
 
   The one broadcast against Largent said he was favoring "Boston,
 bureaucrats and biomass" because the House member had joined with Rep.
 Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a measure that industry officials said
 could have required utilities to use alternative energy sources. A
 memo from late 1998, six months before the campaign, gave a taste of
 the utilities' displeasure with him, describing the firms as "highly
 alarmed by Largent's obtuseness" and noting they "could make Largent's
 life very uncomfortable."  Some congressional Republicans hold Citizens
 for State Power
 partially responsible for defeating White, who lost his swing seat to
 a Democrat, Jay Inslee. A year before the November 1998 election, the
 group aired an ad saying White wanted to raise utility rates by 35
 percent, and it also circulated a poll and memo among political
 professionals showing that White would be beaten easily, in part
 because of his embrace of deregulation.
 
   "For the first time in this debate there were palpable
 political consequences for appearing to support" deregulation, a June
 1998 document said. "In the case of Rick White, those consequences
 were direct and career threatening."
 
   White said he doubted the ads played much role in his defeat,
 but he recalls his unease at realizing a GOP group was targeting him.
 
   "I was a loyal member of the Republican cause, and this was a
 case of shooting a friend in the foot," he said.
