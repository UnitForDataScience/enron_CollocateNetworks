
 
 Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.
 
 In true "swedish hostage syndrome" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of 
 IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the 
 "industry" is under siege and that "just saying no" to price caps isn't 
 politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price 
 caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head 
 of California's generator association to avoid the topic.
 
 We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal 
 and offered the following message points:
 
 Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again.
 FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms 
 necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for 
 price caps altogether.
 The most important reforms include:
 Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supplywell-functioning, 
 efficient markets require peakers.
 Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary.
 Disincents energy efficiency.
 IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the 
 proposed cap.
 
 Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us 
 today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others 
 we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
