
 
 FYI
  cut out York Paper as the
 middle man.  This has resulted in a "fair erosion of business" for York
 Paper.  It is "not just a matter of subsequent solicitation."  It also
 involves "interference with existing contracts" between York and its
 customers. 
 
 So, it would seem that York's claims might include breach of contract,
 interference with contractual relations and, perhaps,
 misrepresentation/fraud.  Interestingly, he did not mention any of the West
 Coast and Garden State Paper contracts we have been looking into.
 
 If you have any thoughts, please let me know.  I will keep you informed of
 any further developments.
