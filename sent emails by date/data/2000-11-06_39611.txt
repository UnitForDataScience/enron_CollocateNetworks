 Rob and Vicki:
 
 Over the past few months we have participated in an initiative aimed at 
 developing a voluntary set of guidelines governing human rights and security 
 arrangements.   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, review, and sign 
 off on the guidelines.  
 
 Should we agree to endorse the principles, we must send a letter to the U.S. 
 State Department by November 8, 2000.     I have attached a fact sheet as 
 well as the revised principles for your review.   
 
 The principles and signatories will be announced by Madeline Albright and 
 Secretary Robin Cook in November. 
 
 Thank you for time and consideration on this.  Please do not hesitate to call 
 with any questions.  I can be reached either by cell phone (917) 821-0724 or 
 by  voicemail at 212-702-3916.
 
 Best Regards, 
 
 
 Lauren
