 Further to my voicemail, I attach the string of emails which highlights the=

 concern relating to personal trading by Enron staff (please see section VII=
  -=20
 Miscellaneous - Employee Trading).
 
 I appreciate you are tied up at a management conference, but if you could=

 possibly get word to me on who I should speak to to resolve this, I would b=
 e=20
 very grateful.  Many thanks

  Certificate =20
 
 Cassandra,
 
 Richard asked me to review this document before the traders on the UK Gas=
 =20
 Desk would sign it.
 
 The UK gas desk adheres to all the risk management requirements of this=20
 document. However, in Section VII , Miscellaneous, Employee Trading, the=20
 document would appear to prevent any of us trading equities (amongst other=
 =20
 commodities) on our personal account as Equity Trading is a Commodity Group=
 .=20
 We are unsure if this is the aim of this agreement.
 
 We have asked our compliance officer, Paul Simons to clarify the impact of=
 =20
 this clause for us.
 
 We are not ignoring the document, we are waiting for clarification.
 
 Thank you,
 
 David Redmond
