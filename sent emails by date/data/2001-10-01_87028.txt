 Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.
 
 Thanks,

 Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
 right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
 get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
 I'll let you know what I find.
