 been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by 
 the house you grew up in.  I thought about you every time I drove by, and I 
 had to find you.  Congratulations on your marriage.  Where did y'all meet?  
 How's your family?  Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.  I 
 can't believe I waited this long  Do you remember Rachel Haygood?  She's still one of my closest 
 friends and she says "HI."
