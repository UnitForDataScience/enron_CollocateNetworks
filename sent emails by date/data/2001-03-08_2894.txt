 trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a
 glamour profession, even for forecasters who never even intended
 to predict the weather on television, the Wall Street Journal
 reported.
      Weather affects commodities trading and determines
 electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large
 energy trading companies like Enron Corp., Williams Cos. and
 UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the
 paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command
 $60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the
 National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.
      Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
 bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast
 and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.
      Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
 trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
 most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented
 worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.

 SINGAPORE, March 8 (Reuters) - PetroChina has mapped out plans for a massiv=

 pipeline gridwork to be in place by 2005 and to ship huge hydrocarbon=20

 officials said on Thursday.=20
 "A total of five pipelines are planned in the 10th five-year plan=20
 (2001-2005), four gas and one for refined oil products," a senior industry=
 =20
 official told Reuters by telephone from Beijing.
 Officials estimated total cost of the projects at 50 billion yuan ($6=20
 billion) at least.=20
 Topping the agenda and the largest of the five projects is the 4,200-km gas=
 =20
 trunk line winding eastwards from China's central Asian region Xinjiang to=
 =20
 the Yangtze River Delta.=20
 Construction of the $4.8-billion project is set to start later this year.=
 =20
 Officials said construction would begin with the 1,600-km eastern section=
 =20
 from Jinbian in northwest Shaanxi province to Shanghai, where initial gas=
 =20
 supply is expected to land in 2003.=20
 The longer western section connecting Tarim to Jinbian is slated for=20
 completion by 2005, officials said.=20
 PetroChina aims to move between 12 and 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas=
 =20
 through the trunkline in 2005.=20
 HUGE UNTAPPED RESERVES=20
 Officials estimated about 720 bcm of recoverable gas reserves remain in the=

 Shan-Gan-Ning and Tarim basins. PetroChina's most recent big discovery in t=

 Sulige field in the northern Ordos basin has proven reserves of 220 bcm.=20
 PetroChina is hoping to lure foreign firms to invest in the project,=20
 including top three oil majors ExxonMobil , Royal/Dutch Shell Group and BP=

 Amoco .=20
 Also under planning is a three bcm-per-year gas pipeline from Jinbian to=20
 Beijing, Hebei and Shandong. Sources said Shell and PetroChina were jointly=
 =20
 studying the project.=20
 A third gas line is planned from Zhongxian in the gas-rich southwest Sichua=
 n=20
 to Wuhan and Hunan provinces in central China, officials said.=20
 U.S. gas and electricity firm Enron Corp is a joint developer in the Sichan=

 gas block, which will send supplies via the proposed 740-km line.=20
 Sichuan, which produced 7.995 bcm of gas in 2000, is presently China's top=
 =20
 gas producer, according to official data.=20
 The fourth gas pipe, stretching 953-km eastwards from Qaidam basin to Lanzh=
 ou=20
 in the northwest, is expected to be operational in May with an annual=20
 capacity of two bcm, according to Beijing-based industry newsletter China=
 =20
 OGP.=20
 The project, which targets PetroChina's subsidiary refineries in Lanzhou,=
 =20
 will cost 2.25 billion yuan, China OGP said.=20
 LONGEST PRODUCTS LINE TO MOVE OIL SOUTH=20
 PetroChina also is set to build a 1,247-km refined products pipeline from=

 Lanzhou to oil-thirsty Sichuan to move surplus products out of the remote=

 A feasibility study for the line, which would be the longest products=20

 Officials said the project would replace rail transport and eventually cut=

 When built in 2005, PetroChina would be supplying five million tonnes a yea=
