 Hello, Kim Theriot and Leslie Reeves have spoken with Debbie Brackett in 
 credit to discuss the payment date for financial power transactions done on 
 EnronOnline.  The confirmation letters (for all financial power trades) that 
 I send out have the following payment date language on them:
 
 The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price 
 is determinable (for trades one month or longer)
 
 The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that 
 includes the Determination Period (for trades less than one month)
 
 The language on EnronOnline is different.  EnronOnline has 10 calendar days 
 instead of 5 Business Days (see the EnronOnline definition below).
 
 Debbie Brackett wants the payment date to remain as 5 days for netting 
 purposes across ENA.
 
 Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do in order to get 
 this language changed on EOL for all financial power products.
 
 Thank you,
 Melissa
