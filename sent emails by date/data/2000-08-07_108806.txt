 ?
 Perhaps:
 ??? if the client is set such that the  property
 ???????  UseAutoGainControl=TRUE
 ??? then the client is attempting to adjust the microphone level  
 automatically.
 ??? A guess on my part is that if the sound card is somehow unable  to 
 automatically adjust the mike level, then an error such as the one described  
 could occur (?).
 ?
 ??? Could this be the case here?
 ?
