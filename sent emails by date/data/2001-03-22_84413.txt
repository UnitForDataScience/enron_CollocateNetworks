 central time.  My morning is a little tight.

 Gerald,
 
 Keith McClelland (AMUS lawyer), Daniela Horth (Contract Administrator for
 AEC Storage and Hub Services Inc. and Wild Goose Storage Inc.)  and I are
 available tomorrow morning between 10 and 12 for a conference call.  I am
 still trying to confirm that Ryan McGeachie (Credit Analyst) is available.
 Does this time look okay for you?  Let me know and I can confirm everything
 later today.
 
 If you do have any written comments that would be useful for us to see
 beforehand, please send them on to me by email or by fax (403-290-8479).
 
 Thanks so much.
 
 Ann
