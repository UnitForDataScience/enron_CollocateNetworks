 the Precedent Agreement with Kern and any associated firm transport contracts 
 and to meet Kern's credit requirements in doing so.  I would propose the 
 following in addition to the Guarantee language;
 
 Calpine agrees to satisfy any requirements of Kern River and execute any and 
 all documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate, as of the 
 Closing, the permanent assignment/release  from Enron North America Corp. to 
 Calpine of (i) that certain Precedent Agreement for Firm Transportation 
 Service between Enron North America Corp. and Kern River dated], in favor of Kern River Gas Transmission Company effective as 
 of the Closing, and in furtherance thereof, agrees that Buyer shall either 
 provide its own guarantee in favor of Kern River Gas Transmission Company or 
 such other form of security as shall be acceptable to Kern River Gas 
 Transmission Company in order to obtain such release.

 Below is the covenant we have in the PSA regarding release of the gas credit 
 support.  When will a shipper be required to put up the credit support?  
 Would anticipate we would have trouble obtaining a written release from Kern 
 if Calpine agreed to provide the required support?  Would we receive a 
 written release if Enron puts up a guarantee (which by definition covers the 
 entire 15-year term) and Calpine puts up a three year evegreen LC?  Thanks.
