 The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about these matters.  Thank you.
