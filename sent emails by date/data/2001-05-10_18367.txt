 We have been working with Mike Connaly and his boss, Mel Calais, at SCE to 
 expedite deployment of pulse meters.  Do you know the chain of command there 
 and if there is anyone higher that we could call if work continues to move 
 along at a snail's pace.  Please call me (713-646-7086) or respond by e-mail, 
 if you can't reach me.
 
 Thanks,
 j
