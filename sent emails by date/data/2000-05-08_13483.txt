  not on 
 an hourly basis.  If I am off base let me know, otherwise I would like your 
 help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having 
 this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees performing exempt jobs 
 that are working part-time or reduced schedules. 
 
 Look forward to hearing back from you.
