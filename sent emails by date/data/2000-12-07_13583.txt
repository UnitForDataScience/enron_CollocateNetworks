
 
 please preparre a "no thanks" letter to this person.  Thanks.  Michelle
 
 Just a note to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you
 today.  Thank you for taking time to learn more about my background and
 experience and to share your Enron story with me.  I am very interested in
 the available position because I welcome the opportunity to learn new things
 and improve my skills.  Although I have not worked at a law firm, I am
 fortunate to say that my in-house experience has been very hands-on with most
 of the transactions and all of the labor matters handled without outside
 counsel.  I discussed this point at some length with Elizabeth Sager and left
 a reference list with Molly McGee in HR.  Looking forward to hearing from you
 soon,
 
 Alice Ginsburgh
