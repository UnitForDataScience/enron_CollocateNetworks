 All-Employee Stock Option Program
 Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time 
 regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through 
 the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made 
 under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The 
 grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or 
 a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  A replacement program for beyond 
 the year 2000 is under consideration and will likely be reviewed at the May, 
 2000 Board meeting.  If approved, this could result in stock option award 
 grants to eligible employees.  Program awards are subject to and effective 
 upon the approval by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of 
 the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock awards shall be made pursuant 
 to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as determined by the Committee.  
 The exercise price for grants of stock options shall be determined according 
 to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which the award is granted.  This 
 program may or may not be offered in certain domestic and international 
 locations based upon management discretion and/or local labor and employment 
 laws.
