 about a 
 1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This "shock" will be around 
 one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
 according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
 pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
 is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.
 
 It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
 over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
 office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
 unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
 study next month.
 
 As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
 top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
 considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
 the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
 intended to be a "whining" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
 (naturally) bring into review some "last mile" problems where certain SIP 
 measures are the least cost effective.
 
 These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
 in and should not be shared externally.
