 Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining issues, 
 including:
 
 (1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is 
 adequate.  
 
 (2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for 
 dual confirms.  This is too confusing.
 
 (3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too 
 subjective.
 
 The other changes were not substantive.

 Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
 3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
 have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side
 letter agreement."  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
 finalize by April 6.  Thanks.
