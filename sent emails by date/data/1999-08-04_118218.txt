 Mark, you will note we actually asked for the debt Put Company to be changed 
 to ECTR Corp. a couple of weeks ago.

 Can anybody tell me where this company fits in to the Enron group structure? 
 Who are its shareholders and when was it incorporated. Is it definitely a 
 Delaware Corp?
 
 Can you please let me know asap.
 
 Thanks
