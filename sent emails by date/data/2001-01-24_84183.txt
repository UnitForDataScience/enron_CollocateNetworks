 could meet you guys there later. Around 8:00.  Let me know.

 Yeah, they are in our spare closet.  That has been the extent of their use
 for the past few years.  Just holding up boxes of crap.  I have actually be
 looking for some good musicians to jam with, but i guess you will do :)
 Anyway, we need to hook up again.  Maybe at Keneally's?  What are you doing
 this Thursday?

 Hey Kevin,  How is it going cousin?  Found the napkin that you left your
 email address on at Kenneally's.  Man, I really was loaded by the time I
 left that place.  I went down to CC the next day and told my parents we had
 met.  They said they had just been at your wedding not to long before
 Christmas.  Small world!
 
 How's Houston treating you?  Been back to Kenneally's since?  Drop me a
 line when you get a chance.
 
 Gerald,
