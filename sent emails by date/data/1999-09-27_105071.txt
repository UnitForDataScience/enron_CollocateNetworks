 "quick fix" is to only permit ONE Transaction using a deemed ISDA.  The 
 broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a "financial 
 institution" under French law.  We tried to push ECT into that defintion, but 
 without success.  The next step is to require  an opinion from outside 
 counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution.

 I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French 
 counterparties are ok?
