 You can now retrieve most all the speaker presentations of the 2001 Energy 
 Finance Conference (Feb 22-23) from our website at 
 http://cefer.bus.utexas.edu, with the exception of presentations made by John 
 McCormack, Peter Nance, Sailesh Ramamurtie, and Ehud Ronn / Anoop Kapoor, 
 which I hope to still receive.
 
 Sincerely,
