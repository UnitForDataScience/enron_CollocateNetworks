 Susan's office.  We're on a conference call with SoCalGas right now talking 
 about the settlement document.  Would you guys pull-up the attached file, 
 "Primary Rights 4-12.doc" and look it over, with particular reference to the 
 section titled, "Scheduling Priority?"  I think we're OK here, but I don't 
 want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter 
 or that just doesn't make sense.
 
 We're down to the final telecon on this subject, and all changes need to be 
 sent over to SoCalGas ASAP.  Will you take a quick look and send Susan a note 
 saying thumbs up or down?  Thanks a bunch.
