 counterparty basis and it says that any applicable master agreement will 
 control.  
 
 Leslie Hansen is also working on a draft.  If you get something from Justin, 
 please forward a copy to me and Leslie.
 
 Thanks,

 Mark,
 
 What is your position regarding U.S. financial EOL trades?  Do you want to 
 adopt the same position? (i.e. to override a master, we need a letter sent to 
 the customer)?
 
 I believe Justin is drafting something for the physical side. Shall I forward 
 a copy to you when it is complete?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave

 The underlying contractual structure for trades effected on-line between the 
 relevant Enron entity and a Counterparty is as follows:
 
 if there is an existing Master for the particular product between the 
 contracting parties, that Master will govern on-line trades.
 if there is no Master between the parties, then the applicable on-line GTCs 
 will apply. 
 
 If the terms of a Master are unacceptable to us for whatever reason (e.g. due 
 to insufficient credit provisions), then it may be appropriate to terminate 
 that Master.  
 If however, we wish to keep a Master in place but do not wish to use it for 
 on-line trades, then the counterparty needs to be notified of this and give 
 its consent.  Such notice could state that until the Master had been suitably 
 amended (i.e. by the negotiation of new credit provisions), then the on-line 
 GTCs will apply.
