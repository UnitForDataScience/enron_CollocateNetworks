 You weren't too late afterall.  You know I don't mind eating really late.
 I'm glad you liked it.
 
  
 
 I'm running on zero sleep and had a 7:30
 conference
 call this morning.
 
 That said, the dinner was really extraordinary.  You guys outdid
 yourself.
 Made an others tough day very nice.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
