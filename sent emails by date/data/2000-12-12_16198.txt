 1. General
 May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
 same ones causing the electric problem





  
  
 Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
 gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
 Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
 supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
 that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.
