 e-requests.  You may consider my request withdrawn.
 
 Thanks,

 Good morning Ms. Adams,
 
 Please see the note below from Iris Meunier regarding the Gas & Power Trading 
 Calendar.  Please advise of the following three questions:
 would you like to take ownership of the Calendar;
 should the Calendar still be in use; and
 can V. Charles Weldon be given access to the Calendar.
 
 We thank you for your time and assistance.
 
 Have a nice day,
 Gary Sta. Maria

 Good afternoon,
 
 V. Charles Weldon has submitted an eRequest for access to the Gas & Power 
 Trading Calendar on ECTLON-LN3.  We do not access to view the ACL to see 
 which group to add the client.  Please let us know if there is a group or 
 when the client has been added to the ACL.  Attached below is the link to the 
 Calendar.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.
 
 
 
 Have a nice day,
