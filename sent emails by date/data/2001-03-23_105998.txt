 me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
 know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge 
 ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
 reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
 want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara
