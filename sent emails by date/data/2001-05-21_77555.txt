 Raimund:
      Thanks for you electronic copy of the letter where Enron directs us to
 proceed to develop a Construction & Connection Agreement for the Midway
 project.
      Today, I'm sending to ENRON a hard copy of the attached report.
 
           (See attached file: Enron-Midway Facilities Study.doc)
                          (See attached file: Enron-Midway schedule.pdf)
 
      The latest version of our generic Construction & Connection Agreement
 is attached for you.
           (See attached file: Construction & Connection Agreement
 Generic.doc)
 
      Please note FPL will put together the Appendixes for your project
 within the next 90 days.
