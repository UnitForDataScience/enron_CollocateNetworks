 me.  Let me know if you're still interested.

 Jeff-
 I am putting together a panel at the AB 1890 Retreat on natural gas issues
 and would like to include an Enron representative. We are trying to get
 folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the
 ground  at least the day
 sessions! :-)
