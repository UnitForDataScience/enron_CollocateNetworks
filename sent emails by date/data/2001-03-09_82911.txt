 Jay,
 
 Here is the current communication error message:
 
 
 
 
 Can you please replace the above paragraph as follows:
 
 "YOUR TRANSACTION MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL due to a communication 
 failure."
 "To confirm whether or not your transaction was successful, please try to 
 login again and use the "Transaction History" function to see a list of all 
 your completed transactions.
 
 If you have any questions or are not certain of the status of a transaction, 
 please contact us immediately on:"
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
