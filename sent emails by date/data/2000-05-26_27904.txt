 the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
 Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
 team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
 week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
 outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the keyrevising Dennis' joint 
 venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
 concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
 including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
 I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
 or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
 turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
 or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
 money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
 deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
 revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF
