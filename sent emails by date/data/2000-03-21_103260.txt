 perhaps interested in ENA.
 
 
 


  
  
 
 Sami:
 
 Thank you for your emails this morning.  Attached is a copy of Esteban
 Buljevich's c.v. as you requested as well as a copy of his list of selected
 transactions.
 
 I am very pleased that you will be speaking to Randy about Pablo de Rosso.
 
 Please let me know if John Novak requires my assistance in arranging to
 speak with Joaquin Sales Saborit.
 
 Regards,
 Stanley Ross
