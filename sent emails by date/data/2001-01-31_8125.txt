 either. 
 
 Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a 
 plan?  (Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the 
 occassion.)  Who knows...
 
 Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that 
 too.  so am not sure if we
 could have made the N.C. deal anyway....
 
 If I get to be like Mom or Dad, smack me around, ok?
