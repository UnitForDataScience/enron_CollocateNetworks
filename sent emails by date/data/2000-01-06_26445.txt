      I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
 agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
 those
 being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
 aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
 go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
 work
 through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
 through
 the transition.
 
 Thanks, Richard
