Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

 ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!
 
  
     
 Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -
