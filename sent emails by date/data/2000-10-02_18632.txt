 Jeff-
 I am always interested! The angle we are looking for is the natural gas
 marketing side of things. Are YOU still interested? YES.  And I am getting you
 because you are afraid to expose anyone else from your company to the
 wildness and unpredictability of the AB 1890 Group? NO at least the day
 sessions! :-)
