 Jeff, I tried to contact Jennifer Burn regarding Mark Fievert's availability
 for April 27th and May 11th and I understand that she is out of the office .
 I am meeting with Pedro Reinhard on monday around the planning for your trip
 to midland and it would be good to know if Mark is joining you on the trip.
 Thanks.
 
 Best Regards,
