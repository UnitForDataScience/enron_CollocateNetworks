
 
  too many damn papers to
 write!
 
 Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
 I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
 down there.
 
 In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:
 
 401 Village at Vanderbilt
 Nashville, TN  37212
 615/ 321-9648
 
 Keep in touch,
 
 Chad
