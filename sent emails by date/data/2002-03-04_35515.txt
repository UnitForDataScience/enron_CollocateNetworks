 CONTRACTS
 
 Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)  This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816.  This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.
 Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign)  Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company
 Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)
 Supply Aggregation Servic [Germany, Chris]   e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)
 
 
 INFORMATION REQUIRED
 
 Is the contract active or how/when did EES dispose of it?
 Did EES nominate under the agreements since November 30, 2001?  If so, provide nomination by day.
 Does EES need to retain the contract?
 How much pre-petition and post-petition claims are due to Tennessee?
 Are there any contract imbalances remaining that need resolution?
 For transport assignments, can contract be re-released back to NYSEG?
 Can EES provide a copy of the contract, capacity posting and back-up information for the bankruptcy files?
 
 As always, there is a short turnaround time to complete Enron's response to the filing.
 
 Please respond by Monday, March 4th.
 
 Thanks,
