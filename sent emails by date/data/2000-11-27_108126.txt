 exchanges are.  I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities.  
 It's unclear what they bring, and how does this help us?  what do you think?

 We have had some meetings with the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and they are very 
 eager to link to us on Weather.
 What's your general opinion about linking EOL to other Exchanges when it 
 comes to Weather contracts?

 They have also to some extent investigated the possibility to list Real 
 Estate derivatives at the Exchange. The way to do this would be to construct 
 an index based on the closed deals in the real estate market. There could be 
 separate indeces for the different part of the country or just one common 
 one. Is this something we could do as well?? It would be a good instrument 
 for institutions with large real estate portfolios as well as private 
 investors (those saving for a house or the ones owning real estate).
