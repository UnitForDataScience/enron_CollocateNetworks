 Whats up?  I think tomorrow seems to be a big ax day over here for many of the groups in EIM and EGM.  It's getting pretty grim here on the trading floor.  Most people seem to think that this deal will not go through and that we will go into Ch. 7.  Trading has really slowed down.  How do things look over there?
