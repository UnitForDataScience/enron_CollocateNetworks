 Any luck helping Debbie with this?  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 Kim, 
 
 There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.  Can you tell me who I need to talk with.
 
 Debbie
