 note, I will be out of the office on Friday.
 
 
 Here is the proposed confidentiality agreement.  I wasn't sure about the
 exact name for you, so I just put in the generic "Enron".  Let me know if
 this is okay.
 
 Call me if you have any questions, and I'm looking forward to reaching an
 agreement with you.
 
 Thanks.
