 My guess is that we'll bring him back for another round of interviews, so we 
 can have you talk to him them.

 This was the guy that I mentioned that I was interviewing this Friday for the 
 Associate program.  He was at Network Oil and seems to have a good 
 background.  Let me know if you or someone else in your group would like to 
 interview him.
