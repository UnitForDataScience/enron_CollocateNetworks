 Richard,
 
 Have you received the check from Teldata?  I have our signed version of the 
 settlement agreement dated 4/5 but I haven't received their executed copy.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Andy

 Hi Andy,
 Just checking on the status of the amount we're going to collect from 
 Teldata.  Is it still around $450k?
 Thanks,
 Mike
