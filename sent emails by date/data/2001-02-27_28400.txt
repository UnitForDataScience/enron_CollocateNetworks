 that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that 
 index deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar to 
 questions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she 
 thought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she 
 viewed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra 
 may have been required to answer questions like these???  Kathy R:  have you 
 seen any above-max index deals involving Sempra?  It may have been CPUC 
 questions she was referring to, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it.
 
 Gillian would like to get a fax of our responses to her at 213-244-8820 as 
 soon as they are ready.  Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done.  
 She said she'd send hers to us as soon as she could, but I didn't push for a 
 draft to review as her thinking sounds consistent with ours.   
 
 As for Sid, Scott Walker's regulatory guy won't be available until tomorrow 
 morning.  Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers.  Scott was 
 appreciative of the extension, but frankly didn't sound like he planned to 
 meet the Tuesday deadline anyway.  In fact, I'm not sure he cares all that 
 much about meeting the new Wed. deadline.  DF
