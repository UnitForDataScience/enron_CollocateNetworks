 Hi Larry, 
 
 You may have received a voicemail regarding the above. I am working with Treasa Kirby here in Global Finance and was wondering whether you have signed copies of the Morgan Stanley confirm for the above $150m oil prepay executed in Dec 2000/Jan 2001. We need to roll-over the oil prepay and need to discuss with the lawyers to understand whether any changes need to be made to the confirms. If you do have signed copies, kindly send both of us a copy of the same asap. 
 
 Thanks & Regards
