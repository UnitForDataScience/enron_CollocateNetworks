 I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. 
 Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand 
 destruction. 
 ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- 
 Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are 
 underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy 
 is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is 
 changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power 
 demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on 
 what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying 
 is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries 
 will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure 
 in service industries.
 ? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock

 Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now 
 is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it 
 be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short 
 term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power, 
 williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500 
 or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the 
 front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we 
 or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years.
