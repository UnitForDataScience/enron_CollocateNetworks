 	I look forward to receiving the copies.  I do not know much about these at all except that we seem to be constantly adjusting these in one way or another.  The lawyer who probably knows the most about these is Paul Simons in London.  Perhaps we can touch base with him tomorrow.

 Please see attached.  Have double checked with Paul and these are the correct docs.  Please let me know if you need anything further.
 
 Thanks.
