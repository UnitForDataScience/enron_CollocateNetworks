 Salt River Project has attached their Schedule to the Master and their Credit support Annex to this email.  I know we have sent them our docs in the past so I don't know where this will take us.  It doesn't look like they have entered the pertinent credit information into the annex.  Are they expecting us to do this?  Please let me know what you think.  The guy that sent this to me is Mark Russell and his email address is below.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
