 I just realized that Monday is a holiday for  us so we will not be able to
 have our conference call then.
 
 We have scheduled one between the lenders and Bob Shapiro for Tues. am.
 (2/20).   I propose that we schedule one after that with you, KFW & OPIC at
 10:00am Tuesday.    The timing of all of this subject to no conflict with
 Frank's schedule, and he is out today.
 
 Let me know if 10am on Tuesday works for you and your team.
 
 Have a good weekend.
