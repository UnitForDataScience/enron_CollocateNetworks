 I am not sure if I mentioned the depreciation issue on the voicemail.  The issue is that there was an increase in the capital cost of the plant (due to additional upgrades and CAPEX that was done after Kevin's agreement with Lavo was cut).  This resulted in an increase in the actual depreciation figures.  Kevin feels that his original deal, based upon the cost of the plant at the time, should be honored.
