 As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.  I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.
