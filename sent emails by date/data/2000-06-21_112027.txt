 Enclosed is Alan's response to the draft.
 
 Do you know if Enron Corp is prepared to execute a similiar guarantee?
 
 I believe that the introductory sections on liquids could be expanded to 
 include, SO2 and NOx and other emission credit trading, coal, bandwidth and 
 pulp, paper and other wood products trading.

 Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
  We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
 little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
 difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
 please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
 something credit can send to counterparties?
 Thanks.
