 things?  
 
 P.S. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM 
 and made a whopping $415 MM!!!  Are they gouging San Diegans?  Are they 
 "gaming" the system?  Inquiring minds want to know.  You may want to check in 
 with Smutney when Edison made the statement.  There may be nothing to it, but 
 it might be interesting to check into.  Is Edison one of those "profiteers" 
 who ought to give San Diegans a refund?

 (Published Sept. 14, 2000)
 Two percent doesn't sound like much of anything, but California's economy is
 just so big  but he's stuck with
 the problem now. Dealing with it could be critical to his political future.
