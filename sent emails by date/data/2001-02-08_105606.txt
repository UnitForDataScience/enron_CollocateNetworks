 know how to send it to you.  It contains opinions, etc.  Either Justin 
 doesn't know if its existence or London never uses it!

 it was fun and I received my certification 
 (hopefully for later use.)
 
 Sara Shackleton mentioned that at one time your office created (and perhaps 
 still updates and utilizes) a legal opinion database with respect to physical 
 and financial trading matters in various jurisdictions.  Could you advise if 
 this is the case?  If so, I would like to visit with you about it.  If this 
 is not within your purview, could you forward this to the correct person and 
 advise me of whom that would be.  We are working to organize our opinions and 
 thought it would be helpful to know what the London office has.
 
 Thanks much.
