 this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -
 I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
 the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
 I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
 we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.
 
 Thanks again.

 Fag boy,
 
 Let me know if you are definitely canceling for Cali so I can set up
 other
 plans.
