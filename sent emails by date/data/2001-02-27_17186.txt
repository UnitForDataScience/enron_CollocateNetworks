  while it is good, I think we
 were successful in removing the direct access suspension language from the
 ALJ's Draft Decision (it was removed in the version released on the morning

 I will fax a copy of the draft to Harry and Sue (I don't have an e-mail
 version). Let me know if you feel we should comment.
