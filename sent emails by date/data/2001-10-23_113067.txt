 gular basis.  Maybe qty instead of monthly.  Nothing formal right now.

 Ginger - Please forward to Gov't Affairs group.  Thanks!
 
 We're trying to identify information needs - both specific and general.  Ma=
 ny of these are already provided, and response to this survey will help in =
 identifying new services and prioritizing/improving existing offerings.  De=
 pending on the response to each offering, most will likely be made availabl=
 e.  For this effort, please rank up to five choices in the list below (1=3D=
 highest).  We'll tally the results, identify which items will have priority=
  and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.  =
 Please note that items marked with (*) would require your input.  Please cl=
 ick on Forward for this message to allow you to type in your ranking number=
 s, and send the response to Rita Hartfield by Wednesday, October 17.
 
 Thanks!
