 I am not sure that I ever had an executed document on the loans.  By copy of 
 this email, I am asking Twanda to send you what she has that has been signed 
 by Dosier.  I will let you fight the payment battles!

 Hi Fran,
 
 Wade Dosier is now in EBS and informed me that he has a forgiveable loan from 
 ENA.  He asked me to make sure that the funds were being processed and that 
 they were being paid by ENA.  Can you please confirm?  thanks
