 As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.
 
 
 However, we do support intra-day capacity release.
