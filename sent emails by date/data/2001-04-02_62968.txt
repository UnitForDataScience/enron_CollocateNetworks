 This is to inform that we received yesterday a hard copy of Resolution SE N? 4, that transfers the Generation License for Modesto Maranzana Power Plant from Arcor to us.
 
 We have already talked with technical people at CAMMESA, and they told us that with this Resolution, they will accept (starting in April) the contract signed between ESA and ECEA to back up the PPAs that ECEA has signed with some Arcor's industrial plants.
 
 I especially want to highlight the support that Mario Aguilar Benitez gave to the regulatory team to get this Resolution signed.
