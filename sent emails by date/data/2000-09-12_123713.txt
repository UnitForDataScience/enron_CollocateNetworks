 I was able to speak w/Greg and Mike McConnell on your Napa Valley 
 conference.  Unfortunately, Greg nor Mike are able to attend.
 
 Many Thanks,

 Greg -
 
 Thanks for giving some additional thought to sending an Enron representative 
 to
 Chase H&Q's Energy and the New Economy conference. I think your suggestion of
 Mike McConnell is great   we 
 will
 work with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley. The panel 
 will
 be first thing on Thursday Spet 21 (probably around 9 am) after which Mike 
 will
 be free to attend other conference sessions, play golf, tour wineries or
 whatever.
 
 The full list of sessions  includes:
 
 Distributed Generation
 Communications
 B2B
 Investor Perspectives
 Energy Exchanges
 Energy Retail
 Venture Stage
 European New Energy
