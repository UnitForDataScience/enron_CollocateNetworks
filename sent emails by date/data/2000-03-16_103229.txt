 on a credit worksheet and then we can turn out a draft ASAP.  Do I need to 
 call Holli?  Do you recall whether you and I had further discussions on 
 this?  Sara

 Sara,
 Holli Krebs has asked for an update on the EWEB ISDA process.  EWEB means 
 Eugene Water and Electricity Board           and is a small Oregon muni.   
 She was under the impression that we had already sent an ISDA to EWEB but,  
 she just got a call from Jim Deisen (the guy you and I met with at that  
 Portland law firmcgy
