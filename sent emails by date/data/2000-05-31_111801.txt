 My fault.  It should say "succeeding Scheduled Payment Date" and Scheduled 
 Payment Date is defined in Section 14 of the ISDA form.  As far as choice of 
 law, we can go with NY although I disagree with your counsel, in that in 
 order for the New York choice of law to be enforced by a court, the parties 
 have to demonstrate some minimum relationship with the jurisdiction chose.

 Carol - two issues:  First, dealing with the applicable law, you can see
 from the copies message below, from our legal counsel, that we will not
 accept Texas law.  Second, I looked through my ISDA booklets and cannot find
 that term "Succeeding Payment Date" defined anywhere.  Can you specify where
 it is defined?
