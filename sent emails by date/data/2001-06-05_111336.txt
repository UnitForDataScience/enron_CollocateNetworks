 What if we said:  "if the
 Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
 Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
 obligation shall be null and void"
 
 With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
 Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
 the Master Agreement"?
 
 I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
 called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
 nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

 Carol:
 
 Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
 surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
 checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
 the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
 week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

 Bill:
 I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
 work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
 importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
 the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
 can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?
 
 Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
 meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
 Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
 in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
 for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
 respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
 something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
 Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
 Does that work for the sureties?
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
