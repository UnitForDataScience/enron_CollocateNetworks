 meeting if it still fits peoples schedules.  I am doubtful but will look at 
 later.

 Mike/Jeff:  
 
 Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
 progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
 offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
 these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
 because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
 this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.
 
 Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
 direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.
 
 I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
 the week because of Thanksgiving
