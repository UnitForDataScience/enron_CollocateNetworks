 you know of any other deals with PGT we currently hold?
 
 Becky,  You knowledge of any other PGT deals we have along with the tariff 
 provisions would be appreciated.  I am trying to prepare a brief for Travis 
 by late tommorrow.
 
 Thanks.

 		  Here is a list of the information that we will need to collect from each 
 master agreement:
 Governing law;
 summary of setoff provisions (in particular, does the contract give us the 
 right to setoff (i) only those transactions under the specific master, (ii) 
 transactions under other agreements between the same counterparties; or (iii) 
 transactions under other agreements between affiliates of the counterparties; 
 (v) all transactions or only those transactions that we elect to offset;
 summary of termination provisions (automatic upon bankruptcy or insolvency of 
 a party? any notice requirements?) 
 summary of liquidated damages provisions (how computed?  provision for 
 two-way LD's (such that even the breaching party gets a payment if they are 
 in the money?) 
 We also need to discuss how we can get comfortable that all transactions were 
 properly booked under the correct master agreement, and that there are no 
 significant "glitches" in our transaction documentation.
