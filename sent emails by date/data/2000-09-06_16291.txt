
 
 the PX.  
 Because the utility has been forced to buy from the PX, and because the 
 market structure in California gives customers no incentive to switch, the 
 utility continues to control the overwhelming majority of the load in 
 California.  
 This gives the utilities monopsony power.  With that power, they can 
 influence PX prices.  
 Solution:  1) Don't make the PX a monopoly. 2) Create a system that provides 
 customers with the incentive to switch.
 
 If you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help, 
 don't hesitate.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
