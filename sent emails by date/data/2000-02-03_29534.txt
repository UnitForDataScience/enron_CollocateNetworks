 My group is frequently asked to provide the top ten or twenty five customers 
 (based on revenues) on our pipelines.   Attached are two files that we just 
 provided to general accounting based on 1999 revenues.  If you recall being 
 asked these questions, you may want to print off the attached spreadsheets or 
 save this lotus note to a file for future reference.
