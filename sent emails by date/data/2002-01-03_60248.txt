
 
 Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered ou=
 t to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.
 
 All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.
 
 I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same.
   physical and fina=
 ncial on Jan 20.=20
 2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=
 EP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=
  HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=
  to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=
 e're in synch.=20
 3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=
 icense of Unify.=20
 4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=
 terparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=
 ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=
 g hard coded reference id risks.=20
 5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =
 potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=
 red to support day one trading.=20
 6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=
 iderations. The time window will be very small.=20
