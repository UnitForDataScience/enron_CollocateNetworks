 received this communication, are interested in this issue and, if so,

 ISO Market Participants:
 
 On March 7, 2001, the ISO distributed funds from the March 5 market
 settlement of the December 2000 preliminary invoice.  The ISO distributed a
 total of $45,779,567.97, of which $352,693.64 was applied to outstanding
 November balances, and $45,426,874.33 was applied to December balances, as
 shown below.   Total amounts payable to Market Participants related to the
 December preliminary invoice were $1,490,781,469.67.  Accordingly, the
 preliminary pay-out ratio for December was 3.05%, and the cumulative
 November pay-out was 24.22%.
 
 Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC
 obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied
 in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has
 been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are
 entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action
 in federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v.
 California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central
 District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an
 order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred
 to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's
 Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a
 segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that
 court.
 
 Payments were made in accordance with ISO Tariff Section 11 and Settlements
 and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6.
 
 The following table provides an overview of the cash settlement:

   Illinova    SCE and
 Illinova remain in default for GMC obligation.
 
 The distributions were made in accordance with the following tariff
 provision:
 
  11.16.1 Pro Rata Reduction of Payments.
  If it is not possible to clear the ISO Clearing Account on a Payment
 Date because of an insufficiency of funds available in the ISO Reserve
 Account or by enforcing any guarantee, letter of credit or other credit
 support provided by a defaulting Scheduling Coordinator, the ISO shall
 reduce payments to all ISO Creditors proportionately to the net amounts
 payable to them on the relevant Payment Data to the extent necessary to
 clear the ISO Clearing Account.  The ISO shall account for such reduction in
 the ISO ledger accounts as amounts due and owing by the non-paying ISO
 Debtor to each ISO Creditor whose payment was so reduced.
 
 As noted above, certain parties have defaulted on their GMC obligations to
 the ISO.  The ISO has a priority claim to the collection of its GMC.  As a
 result of non-payment of the GMC by the parties listed above, the ISO
 reduced the amounts payable to market participants by a total of $591,798.59
 to satisfy the ISO's GMC obligation.  This action was consistent with
 Settlements and Billing Protocol section 6.3.1.3.  Additionally, for those
 parties who defaulted on their GMC obligation to the ISO, but who were to
 receive funds from the market, the ISO has reduced their payout to reflect
 their GMC default.
 
  SABP 6.3.1.3
  The ISO is authorized to instruct the ISO Bank to debit the ISO
 Clearing Account and transfer to the relevant ISO account sufficient funds
 to pay in full the Grid Management Charge falling due on any Payment Day in
 priority to any other payments to be made on that or on subsequent days out
 of the ISO Clearing Account.
 
 Amounts collected from any party are first used to settle that party's
 oldest outstanding amount payable, in accordance with SABP 6.10.4:
 
  SABP 6.10.4
  The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of amounts owing to
 ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of the creation of
 such debts.
 
 Accordingly, amounts received on 3/5/2001, were distributed to November 2000
 and December 2000 creditors.  Payments received from parties who defaulted
 in November were first applied to their November balances.  The $352,693.64
 was distributed to creditors for the trade month of November 2000.
 
 In accordance with Section 11.12 (and SABP 6.10.5) of the tariff, the ISO
 will assess the defaulting parties interest at the ISO Default Interest Rate
 (currently 10.5%:  prime plus 2%).
 
 Certifications are required by Section 11.20.2 of the tariff.  Accordingly,
 the ISO will provide such certification to ISO creditors.
 
  11.20.2 Evidence of Unpaid Amount.
  The ISO shall, on request, certify in writing the amounts owed by an
 ISO Debtor that remain unpaid and the ISO Creditors to whom such amounts are
 owed and shall provide certified copies of the relevant Preliminary and
 Final Settlement Statements, invoices, and other documentation on which the
 ISO's certificate was based to the ISO Debtor and the relevant ISO
 Creditors.  An ISO certificate given under this Section 11.20.2 may be used
 as prima facie evidence of the amount due by an ISO Debtor to ISO Creditors
 in any legal proceeding.
 
 The ISO will report further details on this situation when available.
