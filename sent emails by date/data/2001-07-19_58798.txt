 =09At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG li=
 ne in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.  Our OSSA II (crude ex=
 ports to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely=
  have been taken out with the bomb.  We understand that the bomb, which had=
  a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.  Th=
 e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediat=
 e threat neutralized.
 
 =09However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 day=
 s of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and =
 will notify the Enron Crisis team.
 
 =09We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized =
 a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw=
 ork.  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go o=
 ut in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power=
  fuel supply.  I've notified all relevant government authorities of the sit=
 uation, and so far am getting support.  I've also asked the Embassy to look=
  into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of a=
 n organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be =
 helpful.
 
 =09Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations th=
 roughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perf=
 orm vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.  Until=
  and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano,=
  we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.  We will kick off=
  the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our =
 people complete the overall plan.
 
 =09I will keep you posted as things develop.=20
