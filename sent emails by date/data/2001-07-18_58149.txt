 support the bill (though we are supporting 
 it behind the scenes).
 
 What people don't know:
 Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by 
 Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his 
 signature. 
 Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the 
 Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not 
 postpone).
 Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature 
 will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to 
 postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on 
 the energy legislation at the same time.
 
 Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not 
 get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.
 
 Best,

 Sacramento is one goofy place.
