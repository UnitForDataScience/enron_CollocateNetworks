
 
 I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews 
 for the first quarter.  As long as the New York review isn't the week of 
 January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip.  
 Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me  - I know that you 
 are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical 
 things that you need to handle.  I will try to send you a list of topics that 
 I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting 
 point.  You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while 
 I am there.  Thanks.  Sally
