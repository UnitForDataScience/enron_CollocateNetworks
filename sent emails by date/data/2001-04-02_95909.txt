 Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
 or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
 will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
 to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
 Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
 conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
 and a single or limited number standardized agreements.
