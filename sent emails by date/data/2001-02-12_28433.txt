 Attached for your review and approval are three (3) Agreements:
 
 1.  New contract with Sempra Energy Trading for 35,000 MMBtu/d, SJ Blanco to 
 SoCal Needles, 2 years, Jan. '04 thru Dec. '05, at a Negotiate Rate of 
 $0.50/MMBtu, plus applicable fuel.  Sempra replaces Dynegy who holds this 
 capacity under an Index-Index deal for cal. '03.
 
 2.  Amendment to Sempra Energy Trading, Sempra waives option to increase 
 MAXDTQ under existing Gallup contract from Jan. 1, '04 thru Apr. 30, '05 
 (contract termination date, no ROFR rights).
 
 3.  Amendment to existing Calpine contract, extends term for two (2) years, 
 Jan. '04 thru Dec. '05 on existing Index-Index deal for cal. '03.   Path is 
 SJ Blanco to Calpine South Point del. at Cal. border. 
 
 Agreements (nos. 1, 3) are in credit and capacity approval.
 
 Expedited approval of the Calpine contract is requested as it is an Index - 
 Index transport that will [likely] be hedged immediately upon ETS mgmnt. 
 approval and Calpine execution.  Currently, spread swaps would result in 
 $0.85/MMBtu gross margin for '05, and $0.77/MMBtu for '04.
