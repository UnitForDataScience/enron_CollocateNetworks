 Best,
 Jeff
 
 

 

  
 
 Hi Group,
 
 Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
 and
 ask him to reply to me).
 
 I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
 is
 facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
 provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:
 
 
 Years riding
 How often currently riding
 type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
 type of saddle preferred
 age, height and weight
 
 
 Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
 ride
 on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
 to
 know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
 four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
 redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?
 
 
 Amy
