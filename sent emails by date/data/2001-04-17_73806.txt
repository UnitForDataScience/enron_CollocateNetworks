 Will do...I will ask tonight.
 Our phones went out about an hour ago. That's good and bad...

 Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know
 Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt
 to take off and bring him.  Thanks for the invitation.
