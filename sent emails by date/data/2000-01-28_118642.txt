 is still settled by payment to New York, this one trade probably does not 
 cause too much heartburn. (See the note from Steve Douglas in Tax next 
 following.)

 The EOL help desk received a call from Isabelle Ealet at J Aron in London 
 (0171 774 2103).  She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and 
 password that she had been given.
 
 I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and 
 told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of 
 the form on the web site).  She said she would send one to us.
 
 Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New 
 York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub 
 user.  She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.  I 
 told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood 
 this ?
 
 Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?  
 Please advise as to how we are to deal with this.
 
 Thanks
