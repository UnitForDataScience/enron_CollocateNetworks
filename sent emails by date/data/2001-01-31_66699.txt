
 
 Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard 
 with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, 
 etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but 
 are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They 
 also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are 
 all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 




 
  
 There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to 
 Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The 
 middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I 
 have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or 
 materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that 
 they will want the interconnect. 
 Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of 
 January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate 
 and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 
 
 Thanks
 Earl Chanley

 Rich,
 The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three 
 weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a 
 couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good 
 gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
 Thanks,  Arnie

 Mike this is in your court now. Can it be installed by the middle of 
 February? Arnie has anyone seen  a gas analysis on this?
 Thanks
 Rich

 According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work 
 order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  
 Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, 
 etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will 
 operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still 
 possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

 Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it 
 including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF 
 down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the 
 facilities asap.

 Michelle,
 
 I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on 
 the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded 
 like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What 
 will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I 
 can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a 
 chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut 
 in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the 
 station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and 
 also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as 
 things progress.
 
 Thanks,  Arnie
