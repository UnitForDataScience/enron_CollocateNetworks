 desk to discuss.

 I found out more info on some of these extraneous customs issues above and 
 beyond the LNG stuff:
 
 PHASE I ISSUES
 1. SPM 
  (This equipment has already been imported at 22.38%, but customs is claiming 
 merit duty rates of 67%.)
  This is currently being evaluated by the courts.
  Total Value at Risk = $7 MM
 2. "D" - Stream
  Are Bechtel's design charges of $66 MM specific to our equipment or to the 
 project as a whole? 
  If the former, then duty of 22.38% should apply.
  Total Value at Risk = $13.5 MM  ($66 MM x 22.38%)
 
 PHASE II ISSUES
 1. Services Loading on Power Plant Equipment
  Same issue as for LNG Equipment. Currently we are paying a 10% loading on 
 duty into a reserve deposit to cover this.
  Total Value at Risk = $22.38 MM  ($100 MM x 22.38%)
 2. LNG Equipment to be dutied at 53.8% or 22.38%?
  Think we all know this issue.
  Total Value at Risk = $56 MM (as per Risk Matrix)
 3. Services Loading on LNG Equipment
  Think we all know this issue
  Total Value at Risk = $80 MM  ($149 MM x 53.8%)
 
 TOTAL VALUE at RISK ~$180 MM - - This is WORST, WORST CASE!
 
 Note:  There is still this issue of goods being imported under the wrong 
 classification.  Currently, this is preventing goods from being imported on 
 time, which could lead to delay claims by the contractors.  It will take me 
 some time to hunt down what this could cost us if the problem isn't resolved 
 soon.  Pavan's estimate is that it will take a month for Site to generate 
 accurate equipment lists and for the same to be reviewed and approved by MSEB.
