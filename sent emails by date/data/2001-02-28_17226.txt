 the circumstances
 




 
  
 Attached please find the ENA Government Affairs report for Feb '01.  I tried 
 to incorporate the material from the IRTF reports.
 
 I have asked Eric Benson to help me put these together going forward so 
 hopefully they will be out the first week of the month.  
 
 My other request is to see if people can modify their IRTF to include some 
 new data - WHAT ACTIONS WILL OCCUR IN NEXT 30 DAYS THAT NEED ATTENTION OF 
 MANAGEMENT.  This report is too  backward looking in its current form.  I 
 want to try and make this a listing of what is going to happen over the next 
 30 days to begin to get ENA management thinking about the issues.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
