 I'm in ENA Legal, and I'm looking for the right person to discuss this with.  
 Christi Nicholay suggested I get you involved.  Please give me a call at 713 
 345 7566 to discuss.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our 
 discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as 
 an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors.
 
 I look forward to speaking with you soon.
