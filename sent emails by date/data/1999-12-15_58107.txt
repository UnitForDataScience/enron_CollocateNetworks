
 
 FYI.  These are the items I left Ken a voicemail about.
  that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be 
 calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the 
 Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC 
 in February 2000.
 
 Please let me know if you need additional information.
 
 Thank you.
