 afternoon, and give give blood on Friday.

  some 7-8 units over the
 next couple weeks.  If any of you, your friends, spouses, co-workers,
 etc., have some O+ blood in your system that you wouldn't mind donating,
 I know Michael would welcome it.
 
 Rather than rush down to MD Anderson to donate, please give me a call
 first, and I can give you some of the specifics you'll need.
 
 Thanks.
