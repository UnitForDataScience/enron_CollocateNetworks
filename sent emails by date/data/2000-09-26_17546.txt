 Jess,  what do know about this?  If you have any info let Jeff Nieland 
 know.   
 
 Jeff  N.,  I am not familiar with the Cal. EEP.  In most state it is not 
 unusual for transmission customer (usually all the  customers are involved)  
 to be part of the plans.  Jeff Dasovich or Roger Yang may have more details.

 Hi Dan and Tom,
 
 Greetings.  I hope all is well with both of you and PPG.
 
 I recently received information that transmission voltage customers will
 likely be required to be involved in the Electric Emergency Plan (EEP)
 in the future.  Currently transmission customers are not "required" to
 curtail any load when distribution circuits are taken off line as a
 result of a Stage 3 EEP operation.
 
 Please take a look at the attachment below and if possible provide
 comments to help shape the proposed change.  I will need comments by
 this Friday noon if possible.  Thanks for the input.
