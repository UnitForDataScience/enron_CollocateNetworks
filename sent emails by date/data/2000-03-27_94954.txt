 have alot of generation and are under pressure to get several projects done 
 soon.  I also think that your price risk management structure would be a good 
 product for them.

 It turbines out that KN's Illinois turbines are 
 7EAs (six of them).  I told him that we would still be interested in making a 
 joint venture proposal for the turbines to them.  He is going to have Chuck 
 Walker from his Chicago office call me.
