 Chris,
 
 I was in a meeting today with Jeff Shankman and he was interested in who in 
 the NYMEX was behind their efforts in DC to cause EOL problems. I told him 
 the Enron DC office was pleased with the initial federal government comments 
 regarding protection for EOL from the NYMEX's stance. He still wanted to know 
 who at the NYMEX was causing Enron grief. You may respond directly to him if 
 you wish, but please let me know that you have responded to Jeff so I can 
 consider my request closed. 
 
 Thanks,
 Doug
