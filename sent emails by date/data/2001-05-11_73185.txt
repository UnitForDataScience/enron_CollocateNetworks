 When are you available today to get together and call Ben about the Blue Dog 
 invoices?  As far as I know, Ben's only conflict today is a meeting from 2-3 
 (Houston time), and I can come up to your office any time.
 
 Also, an attorney from King & Spalding (I believe she said her name was 
 Marisa Rudder?) left a message for me last night asking about the status of 
 the original closing documents for the Blue Dog/Northwestern transaction.  Do 
 you know where these are?
 
 Thanks,
 Rebecca
