 presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after 
 I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's 
 in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

  California Crisis  
 
 I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a 
 chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.  I'm giving a 
 talk at Exnet on Monday about California.  Attached is a draft of the 
 slides.  All comments welcome and appreciated.  I'm continuing to work on 
 it.  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
