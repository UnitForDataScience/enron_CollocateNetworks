 eventually respond.  I am on to your twisted little games.

 Hi Ryan,
 
 I'm at DEMA right now setting up all of this year's dive trips!  I got a
 message from my office mates saying they had to box me up and move me to a
 temporary office in the Woodlands.  We have to make room for the HR people,
 but there isn't any room for us downtown yet.
 
 The three of you guys can just show up at the HammerHeads meeting.  There
 should be a reserved section somewhere.  We normally have a few beers and
 talk about dive stuff.  There will probably be lots of pictures from the
 small group trip to Belize in October.  Also, Kennie and I will be going over
 this year's events and trips.
 
 Can you forward Eric's email to me?  Whatever I have written down is
 incorrect.
 
 See you soon,
 Kristi
