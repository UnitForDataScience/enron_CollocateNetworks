 Tabatha, please schedule this meeting for August 10th.  Greg, Gary and I
 should be able to handle it.  Russell, David, Tom - let Tab know if you want
 to attend.  Tab, also invite Kevin Lyng, or whoever he designates, so we
 have someone who can carry the ball on contacting zees who aren't taxing
 correctly.
 
 Also, does anyone have the document showing the taxes and results by store?
 I only have the "here's what we did, here's what we found" letter.
 
 To fix all this, we need to know the correct tax rate per store, the method
 they should be using, and whether parts and/or labor need to be reported on
 the invoice.  Then, our little group can make some consistency decisions
 about how taxes will be computed and reported at the company stores (there
 are some options we need to nail down), then IT will implement.
