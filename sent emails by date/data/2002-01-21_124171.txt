 According to Tim, if we could find no other spots for her to stay in Risk, she would be designated as VM and Kit Blair would be taken off the list.  Do you know what communication is being given to 'estate' employees in Portland?

 The people on the list for VM should be: 
 
 Scotty Gilbert 
 Eugene Lee 
 Donna Sheidun 
 Heather Dunton 
 
 
 
 Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.
