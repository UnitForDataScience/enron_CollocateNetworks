 Tana, hope you're doing well.   
 
 We'd wish to replicate the terms in the ENA-Utilicorp. United Inc. ISDA 
 referred to below in a similar contract between ECTRIC and Utilicorp. United 
 Inc.   Pls send me a electronic copy of the executed contract.  Tks.

 Hi Yumi,
 
 I did confirm with our weather desk that we will be transacting as Utilicorp
 United Inc.  Sorry for the confusion!  How do you want to proceed on the
 ISDA?
 
 Thanks,
