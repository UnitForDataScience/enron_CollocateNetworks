 This is fine though you are welcome to spend more
 time with us this summer.

 Dr. Kaminski,
 
 Thanks for your answer.
 Before I tell you the time frame,
 I'll need to talk with my advisor, first.
 Because here is an on-going-project.
 I need to coordinate the schedule.
 
 I'll appreciate it if you understand my situation,
 and give me some time (less than a week, of course).
 
 For your reference,
 probably
 the dates I'd like to ask you will be
 from mid-May to mid-July (2 months)
 
 Warm regards,
 Jinbaek
