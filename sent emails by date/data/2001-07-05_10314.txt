 Tammy and Mike,
 
 What's the status of our X12 file exchange?  Are we ready to implement
 this?
 
 
 Due to the latest problems in communication between our schedulers, we
 probably should get this in place as soon as possible.  I believe it
 would
 streamline the confirmation process between our two pipes.
 
 Let me know what I can do on this side to expedite getting this
 going....
 
 Kathy
