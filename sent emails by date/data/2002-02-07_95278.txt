 Sorry about not getting back with you.  I am actually out in Vail/Beaver Creek, working on my skiing, since now is a pretty good time to work on that.  I am still interested in talking with your contacts.  I will call you tomorrow morning.  I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon. Thanks again for your patience and help with this issue.
 Regards,
 Ben

 Ben,
 I have been unable to contact you.  Are you still interested in speaking to
 a few of my banking clients here in NY?  I wanted to possibly schedule some
 conversations for the end of this week/beginning of next.  Please give me a
 call.
