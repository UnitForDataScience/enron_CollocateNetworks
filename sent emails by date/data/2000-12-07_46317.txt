 Amita,
 
 Justin has agreed that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms and 
 instead include the following language on the confirms for EnronOnline 
 transactions which are governed under GTC (not governed by Master Agreements):
 
 "This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and 
 Conditions. For a copy of this agreement, please click on the Product 
 Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View GTC".
 
 Justin: Please verify that I have the language correct as per our discussion.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
