 I asked Greg Whalley and he declined (he has a speaking
 engagement in London  a day before).
 
 I have sent an invitation to Louise Kitchen and she has not 
 replied yet. I  shall catch her at the management conference in San Antonio 
 and
 ask for a commitment. It would help if you could mention this to her as well.
