 In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good boo=
 ks for me to read.  I'm gotten a list from Sam and from a friend at school,=
  but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.

 A theory (for the Prince of Peacers):

 I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to Go=
 d.  I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for=
  that matter.  I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re=
 -runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects on=
 e of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we hand=
 le it.  Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air =
 their dirty laundry on T.V.  Then again maybe not.

 I hope all is well.  Glad you like the new job.
