 Joy,
 
 We spoke with John at your office about a proposed idea where EPMI and
 COB book both sides of the parking agreements and then any power COB
 keeps is sold to COB  at a price plus $4 to zero out the parking.  This
 is acceptable for us, and I have tried to get in touch with John several
 times so that he can instruct whoever to make the changes in your system
 and to confirm that this is ok so we can change our system.  However, I
 am not getting any response.  Do you know if any changes have been made
 to your numbers?  If you could get with him and give me a call, we could
 try to close out May!  Thanks.
