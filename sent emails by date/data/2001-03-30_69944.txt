 will make it easy for me to search. 
 
 Thanks, and have a good weekend.

 Will do.  Do you have the serial number and delivery date for the new
 turbine?  Do you have the specifics on how the payment schedule will
 change? Do you want me to wait for that info before I turn the new
 draft?  I need to leave the office today no later than 3:45 CST.

 Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2
 contract
 is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5
 -
 3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March
 12.
 
 
 The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.
 
 Thanks.
