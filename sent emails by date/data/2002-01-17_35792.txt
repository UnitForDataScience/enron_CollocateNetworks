
 
 I have these 2 contracts highlighted in yellow and coded as Agency/Release.  They probably should just be release but I'll let you decide.
 
  
     
 How does the agency with PG&E Energy Services work?
 
 I show that EES is agent for two PG&E contracts.  Contract 67309 on CGAS and 67310 of Col Gulf.
