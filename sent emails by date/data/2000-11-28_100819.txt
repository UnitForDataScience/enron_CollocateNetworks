 Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
 earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
 I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
 Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
 night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
 to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
 wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
 6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
 options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

 HI Susan-? I'm sure you got this cute email, but just in case.....What was 
 the verdict for the weekend of the 15th?? I've just received a recommendation 
 for some even better outlets than the one we visited.....Let me know what you 
 think!? : )

 Don't be GREEN with envy!? Time still remains to
 take advantage of the great $99/$109 or less each 
 way southwest.com only offer.
 ?
 Can we travel can we go?
 Can we go to a show?
 Should we visit our family each?
 Should we hang out on a beach?
 I will book it, you will see.
 I will book it for you and me.
 southwest.com e-Freedom, ma'am
 It's the best, for sure I am.....
