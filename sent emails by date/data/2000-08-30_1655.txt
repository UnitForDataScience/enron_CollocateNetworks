 you know i have a picture of you blown up on my wall, don't you?  So when
 does the fortune story come out?  (lemme guess, sep 11?)
 
 should be pretty solid. Who knows, if EnronOnline gets spun  off
 (obv, not gonna happen) I might even get to cover it... what a  mock!
 Anyway, thought I'd drop you two a line. Hope things are going  well...
 
 can't wait for football... lemme know when  you boys come back out here...
