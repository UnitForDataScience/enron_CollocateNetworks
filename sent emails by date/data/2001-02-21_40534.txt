   I agree with Mike Woolery in him memo below, that we need to have a knowledgable person perform an audit of Mike's entire payroll from the beginning of the SAP payroll system initiation.  Who do I talk to to get this rolling.  Once the audit is complete, we need to sit down with Mike W. and other concerned Shift Operators to review findings and proposed remedial actions to eliminate this type of thing in the future.  I know that Terriann has met with knowledgable SAP administrators and changes in the payroll process have been initiated recently that, hopefully, should address future problems of this nature.
