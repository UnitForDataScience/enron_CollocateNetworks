 Good to hear from you.  It is pretty bad at Enron.  I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.  The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.  The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.  It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money.  
 Oh well, things will work out.
 
 As far as the Rose Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.  Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game 

    
 
 Hey Eric,
 
 Christ almighty, u still got a job?  I bought into Enron at $38 or so..... 
 now they're at 0.61.  I really know how to pick'em.  I lost about 1,300 on 
 ENE.  I should get to watch the game this saturday and am pretty pumped 
 about it.
 
 What all events would have to occur for us to get a Rose Bowl slot?
 
 Yeah, I'm still in HI for another year to year and a half.  I'm going to 
 Telluride with Marilyn from 22 Dec to 27 Dec to do the whole proposal thing 
 then I leave Hou on the 2nd of Jan.  So if ur in town from 27 dec to 02 jan 
 lemme know.
