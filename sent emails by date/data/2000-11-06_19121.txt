 yes but a true Nader voter would never want to spend that kind of $$ on wine! 
  Could the 1997 Opus One be 
      that elusive wine that one never finds? In my continual pursuit for 
      wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy 
      and Australia and for what? Besides losing my luggage, tracking 
      through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been 
      searching for that wine of perfection. Could this wine finally be the 
      one? This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red 
      wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count). 
      Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One magnificently perfumes 
      the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit, fragrant, sweet earth 
      and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of perfection, 
      this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of 
      Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux 
      (82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 
      1% Petit Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention. This is 
      my top wine of the year. (Best Served 2002-2018). ($130)
