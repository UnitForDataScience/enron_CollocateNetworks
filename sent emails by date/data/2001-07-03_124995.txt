 Thanks for the update.
 
  

    
 A fast way to see the MCP is under Energy Prices at http://www.caiso.com/.
 You'll notice that in hours 15, 16, 17 and 18 yesterday the MCP was set by
 the proxy price when we were in a Stage 1 then 2 Emergency.  Other hours
 were set by the previous Stage 1 cap.
