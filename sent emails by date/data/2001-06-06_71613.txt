 type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the 
 balance sheet.

 If we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext, wouldn't the big 
 concern be that we've put $1.8 million of land plus an additional $900,000 or 
 so of obligations to build road and stormwater system on the balance rather 
 than the rather small ongoing costs related to maintainance of the road and 
 system?

 Kay:
 
 Greg has Christi's comments on the FPL Construction & Connection Agreement, 
 and he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we 
 engaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I'd like to have a 
 commercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance 
 to comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on 
 given his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?
 
 Please let me know. Thanks.
 
 Attached is the original generic form of FPL Connection and Construction 
 Agreement for your reference.
