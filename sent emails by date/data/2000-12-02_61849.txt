 I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out 
 more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron 
 appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely 
 well respected in this field.
 
 Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management 
 products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for 
 pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the 
 Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas 
 future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 
 
 If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right 
 direction it would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Thank you in advance for your assistance,
 
 Michael Fuss
