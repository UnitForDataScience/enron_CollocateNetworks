     Shelley,
 
          I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
 computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
 program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!
