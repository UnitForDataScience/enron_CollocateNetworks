 similar to the way 
 we've classified excess fuel retention revenue in TW's 1999 GAAP statements.

  Accounting Memo  
 
 I would think at a minimum we would like to have some kind of a tracking 
 account (nojn-FERC)  for accounting purposes to be able to tell the earnigs 
 impact of the transactions.      I have a problem with recording the revenue 
 in a plain transportation revenue account since it will skew the percentage 
 of transport revenues collected from demand charges  which is an important 
 piece for the financial world.   Ultimately I guess FERC will tell us how to 
 account for it.
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 





 
  Accounting Memo
 
 From what we have so far been able to learn about the referenced proposal, 
 and after discussions with Dan Fancler, I prepared the attached draft of an 
 accounting memorandum for your consideration.  
 
 Please advise if you have additional facts or ideas to be considered.
 
 
 
 By copy of this memo I'm asking Jerry Moore for excise tax advice as to 
 whether TW would risk incurring excise tax if we record gas sales to the 
 shippers and then retain the volumes for fuel.
