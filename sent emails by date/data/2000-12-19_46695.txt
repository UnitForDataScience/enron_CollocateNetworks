 NDA.  Did you have it to my attention, Tana Jones, at fax no. 713/636-3490?

 Hi,
 When you have an opportunity, please forward this to me by courier or I will 
 be more than happy
 to come by and pick this up.
 
 Thanks again

 We do not appear to have received your fax of the NDA.  Can you please fax
 it to my attention at 713/646-3490 and I will distribute it to the members
 of the Enron Team.  Thanks!

 I will fax a copy to your attention and you can distribute to your people
