
 
 There have been some ongoing disputes with AEP I think we should look into before cooperating fully.  I'll check with Elizabeth Sager and get back to you.
 
 

    
 
 
 Attention:  Kathy Moore
 
 Kathy, thanks for your help.
 
 The historical trading information we are looking for are for the Off-peak
 monthly/bimonthly/quarterly and/or annual contracts for the 12 months of
 December 2001 through November 2002 for the trading locations of Into
 Cinergy and PJM West.
 
 We need the trading information for these contracts for the 10 trading days
 of October 8, 16, and 24 and November 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
 
 We would appreciate all of the information you have archived on these
 contracts for these trading days, including, as available, bids and asks
 (at closing, and if available, throughout the day), transactions and
 volumes, and the day's volume-weighted prices.
 
 As we discussed, the reason for this request is that American Electric
 Power received an Order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission
 (VASCC) to use EnronOnline market prices along with others for the
 determination of competitive transition charges (wires charges) for VA
 retail customers.
 
 By this e-mail, AEP is also seeking approval to disclose the market prices
 provided by EnronOnline to the VASCC, and other parties as necessary, as a
 part of this filing.  This filing is due at the VASCC this coming Monday,
 December 3rd.
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
 Thanks again for your help.
