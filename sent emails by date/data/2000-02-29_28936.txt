 couple of weeks with you guys clearing your environmental hurdles and the 
 Tioga guys finally starting construction!  I may have acted rashly in joining 
 the evil empire Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
 "We
      expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 
 
      Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
 the Bakersfield
      area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
 expects to have
      more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
 California project
      moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 
 
      Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
 have to connect
      with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
 The combined
      Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.
