 Gujarat, Up High on Power Reforms, By Rajesh Unnikrishnan
 
 Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat are moving ahead with implementing reforms=
  in the power sector, even as the reforms in Maharashtra have come to a sta=
 ndstill due to the Dabhol fiasco. Maharashtra was one of the first states t=
 o initiate steps for reforms phase-II, by appointing a state regulatory com=
 mission and going in for unbundling MSEB. Uttar Pradesh State Electricity B=
 oard and Delhi Vidyut Board are finalising plans to privatise transmission =
 and distribution, while Gujarat is planning to set up one more power projec=
 t with private sector participation.=20
 
 According to State Bank of India Capital Markets officials, UPSEB is going =
 to float a new tender, inviting private sector players for power supply in =
 Kanpur region. Due to employees' protests against the privatisation, the st=
 ate electricity board had cancelled its earlier tender floated in 2000.  SB=
 I Caps had also short-listed four companies: L&T, CESC, BSES and Tata Power=
  for transmission and distribution in Kanpur. The officials said: "UPSEB wi=
 ll come out with a new tariff order for Kanpur by this week end and a new t=
 ender will be floated by month-end. We would undertake the short-listing pr=
 ocess by mid-July."They said that besides this, the UP State Industrial Dev=
 elopment Corporation is also setting up a 30 MW captive power project for t=
 he newly-developed industrial park, Tronica City, in the state. Total cost =
 of the project is estimated at Rs 100 crores and BHEL is the equipment supp=
 lier for the project.
 
 SBI Caps short-listed six private players for supplying power in three regi=
 ons Tata Power, BSES, Reliance Power, China Light&Power, AES, the AV Birla =
 Group and CESC. Two months back, the Delhi government had cleared State Ban=
 k of India Caps' proposal for the unbundling of DVB by dividing the board i=
 nto five separate units. The proposal envisaged three transmission and dist=
 ribution companies and two generation companies. DVB makes losses to the tu=
 ne of Rs 1 crore per day. Officials said the Gujarat, on the other hand, is=
  focussed more on generation and the state electricity board recently propo=
 sed a 500 MW project in Mundra and invited a proposal from the private sect=
 or.
 
 The project will use imported coal as fuel and the state will keep a minimu=
 m equity in it. There are two independent power projects in Gujarat: the Re=
 liance-promoted, 500 MW, naphtha-based Hazira project and the 500 MW, gas-b=
 ased project promoted by Gujarat Power Corporation. According to the offici=
 als, the unbundling of Gujarat SEB has failed to take off because the state=
  government has not yet appointed any merchant banker for it. The governmen=
 t initiated the state electricity board unbundling around two years back.
