 any inherent problem with something like that if it seems to make the most 
 financial sense.  Thanks. df
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 How about doing something along the lines of what we did with UCU on NBPL in 
 phanthom equity stock?  or something like thatstock in Enron?  Profit sharing on the power plant or pipeline 
 ownership entity?  Something else? 
 3.  What do the economics look like?  This is obviously a threshold question 
 that we ought to be moving toward an answer on for ourselves, even if we 
 aren't in a position yet to share the information.  Specifically, given what 
 we know about the likely cost of the pipeline, and the likely capital cost 
 and heat rates of the turbines ENA has available, and what we know about 
 forward gas curves, and what we know about how much power PNM supplies to DOE 
 and at what rate (from the document Tino gave us in KC and PNM's tariff), do 
 we think we can build this thing and beat PNM's current price to DOE?  Can we 
 beat it by 10%?  Can we beat it by 10% and have enough $$$ to sweeten the 
 deal for the Tribe (partly because that would make it more attractive to 
 DOE)?    
 
 I suggested to Tino that he ought to put together a list of the issues that 
 they are working on and that they think we should be working on and what the 
 critical path issues and decisions are.  If we do the same, then we'd be in a 
 position to get another meeting together and have a productive agenda and 
 find out if this project has real potential or not. 
 
 Bottom line, I think if our analysis of question 3 is that we can hit decent 
 RAROC numbers and still undercut PNM's existing DOE contract and cut the 
 Tribe in on a decent share of the power plant upside, we ought to move 
 forward aggressively.    DF
