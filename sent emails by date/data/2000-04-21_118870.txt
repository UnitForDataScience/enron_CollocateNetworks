 Here is the most recent draft of the Reuters document.  You will see that 
 while they didn't give us everything we asked for, they made significant 
 progress on the indemnity.  I'm not sure they have satisfied your concern 
 regarding the Enron affiliates issues - they have added in subsidiaries in 
 several places but refused to change the definition of "Distributor" to 
 include affiliates.
 
 If you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through (to see 
 all of the marked changes) let me or Dave Samuels know and we can forward 
 them to you (I think there were at least 4 versions since the draft we 
 discussed with them the other day).
 
 Since I will be in Brazil on Monday, it might make sense for you to 
 coordinate your reactions with Dave.  If you need me, please leave a 
 voice-mail or ask  my assistant (Taffy x57373) to track me down.
