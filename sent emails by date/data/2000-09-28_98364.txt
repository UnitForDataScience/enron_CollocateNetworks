 	"AARON, KILI, COME HERE." 
 	ANIMAL  KEEPERS AT THE PARK FIND THAT THE BONOBOS ARE SO QUICK AND  SO
 	INTELLIGENT THAT WORKING WITH THEM IS A REAL  CHALLENGE.
 	"THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE CREATURES. THEY'RE  CONSTANTLY PLAYING, MOVING,
 	FORAGING FOR FOOD."
 	BONOBOS  LIVE IN AN AFRICAN RAINFOREST IN THE CONGO BASIN LOCATED IN  THE
 	COUNTRY FORMERLY KNOWN AS ZAIRE. THEY'RE ENDANGERED BECAUSE  THEIR FOREST
 	IS BEING DESTROYED BY LOGGING COMPANIES. AND THEY'RE  HUNTED FOR FOOD. 
 	FEWER THAN 20-THOUSAND OF THESE ANIMALS ARE  ALIVE IN AFRICA TODAY. THE
 	BONOBOS, THEIR UNIQUE SOCIAL SYSTEM  AND THEIR HABITAT ARE UNDER ATTACK IN
 	THE  WILD.

 CAN'T  AFFORD TO MISS.
 	THE TEST IS HERE.
 	THE FIBER OPTIC CERVICAL  PROBE IS NOW BEING TESTED BY DOCTORS IN HOUSTON, 
 TEXAS.
 	AND,  ALREADY THEY BELIEVE IT'S FAR MORE ACCURATE AND DEFINITELY FASTER AT  
 DETECTING CERVICAL CANCER THAN THE PAP SMEAR.
 	CHRISTI MYERS  REPORTS ON WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
 	PAULA  ROBERTS IS ONE OF 400 STUDY PATIENTS WHO WILL BE TESTING A  NEW
 	FIBER OPTIC PROBE.AND COMPARING IT TO THE PAP  SMEAR.
 	"THIS IS THE PROBE THAT WE'RE GONNA USE TO TAKE THE  MEASUREMENTS."
 	THE CERVICAL PROBE WHICH IS BEING TESTED AT  M.D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER MAY 
 SOMEDAY REPLACE THE PAP SMEAR AS A  FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE WAY TO DETECT 
 CERVICAL CANCER. INSTEAD OF  WAITING FOR RESULTS. WOMEN LEARN IF THEY HAVE 
 CANCER OR PRECANCEROUS  CHANGES IMMEDIATELY.
 	"WITH THE PROBE THEY CAN TELL  IMMEDIATELY IF THERE'S A PROBLEM AND TAKE A 
 BIOPSY OR WHATEVER THEY  NEED RIGHT THEN."
 	THE PROBE IS PLACED PAINLESSLY AGAINST THE  CERVIX.SHINING LIGHT ONTO
 	THE TISSUE. CANCER CELLS AND PRE  CANCEROUS CELLS ABSORB LIGHT
 	DIFFERENTLY
 	"WHAT HAPPENS IS  AS CELLS GET MORE DYSPLASTIC AND MOVE TOWARD CANCER, THE 
 NUCLEI  ACTUALLY GET CRINKLED SO THEY REFLECT LIGHT IN A MORE SCATTERED  WAY."
 	THE PROBE'S INFORMATION IS FED INTO A COMPUTER WHICH  INTEPRETS THE TEST IN 
 MINUTES. AND PATIENTS DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WAIT  FOR A DOCTOR TO READ THE 
 RESULTS. PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS AND AIDES  HAVE USED THE DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY 
 IN THE TRIAL.

 EARLIER STAGES, POSSIBLY BEING ABLE TO FIND A CURE  ALSO."
