 next-generation drug to succeed EPO.
 
 On December 22, 1998, Amgen won a critical court ruling over
 Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), which gave AMGN exclusive rights
 to NESP.  As a young, struggling company, Amgen had sold the
 rights to Epogen (EPO) to JNJ, and JNJ claimed NESP, the new
 successor to EPO, was just a revised version of the same
 drug, and was covered under the EPO sales agreement.  EPO is
 one of the top selling drugs in the world.  It's three makers,
 JNJ, Roche, and Amgen sold over $3 billion of the drug last
 year.  EPO must be injected three times a week and is done in
 a hospital setting.  NESP is injected only once per week and
 may eventually be used by the patient at home. It will almost
 certainly replace EPO when the final phase of ongoing human
 testing is completed, and it could give Amgen $1 billion in
 annual sales.  Amgen is also working on Major new drugs for
 weight loss and Parkinson's, but they are 4-5 years away. EPO
 shows skeptics that Amgen really does have important drugs
 in the pipeline.
 
 *AMGN announces earnings on Jan. 27th (according to Zack's).
 They last split 2:1 in 1995 near $100.  They have 750 mln
 shares authorized and only 254 mln outstanding.  A split
 is a definite possibility.
 
 Amgen set an intra-day high Wednesday of $115.44, it's only
 resistance. Even when the rest of the market was diving
 Thursday and Friday, AMGN  was looking strong.  This stock
 has been considered a possible take-over target at times in
 the past, but has wanted to remain independent.  Now Amgen
 has the ability to do the acquiring, if it desires.
