 agreement, I think because he wanted to make comments on the form on the 
 computer so he could prepare a blackline draft.

 Tana - Can you please let me know your query.  Bud Ricketts has had a draft 
 physical power agreement since Sept. of last year. As you can see from the 
 Lotus Notes entry- I called him yesterday to chase him as we have not gotten 
 even a first set of comments from them.  Their Credit Guy is apparently the 
 hold-up.
 
 I am not sure what else needs to be done from our end. Please advise. 
 
 Thanks!
 
 Shari

 Shari,
 
 Tana came by and said to send Bud Ricketts (what a name) a copy of this 
 Agreement but it looks like from the notes below you have already talked to 
 him, etc.  Please advise.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Genia
