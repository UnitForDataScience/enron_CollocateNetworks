 these to Carolyn, but I would still appreciate it if you could investigate, 
 or ask Carolyn to do so.

 Kay: We recently received payment of our June, 2000 invoice. Previously, we
 had received payment of the September, 2000 invoice. This leaves
 outstanding the invoices for July, 2000 (30492348; $9,810.19); August, 2000
 (30502885; $3273.75); October, 2000 (30526950; $1819.73), November, 2000
 (30539817; $1510.45); and December, 2000 ($1675.29). At the request of your
 assistant, I forward the information re the invoices through November to
 the Enron accounts payable help desk, but I did not hear back. Anything you
 can do to expedite payment of theses invoices would be appreciated.
