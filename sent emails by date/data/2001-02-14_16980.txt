 an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities 
 Commission.  
 
 Move to Prohibit Customer Choice
 As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the 
 Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the 
 authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, 
 however, is a provision that prohibits "Direct Access,"  California's term 
 for customer choice.  
 
 In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers 
 from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our 
 understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.  
 Their reasoning is that they need a "captive" customer base to pay for the 
 bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.
 
 Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring 
 law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally 
 flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were 
 protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those 
 businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with 
 competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation 
 takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage 
 their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one 
 choicecan embrace and advocate.
 
 I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of 
 this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please 
 don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
