 I talked to Eduardo Pawluszek (TGS) this morning. So that everybody knows, 
 last week we quoted propane, butane and gasoline. Citibank and Goldman Sachs 
 have also quoted, but Enron came up with the best price. Eduardo told me he 
 is ready to go, but he is still trying to waiting for Marketing to define 
 volumes.
 What the auditors are saying is that if TGS hedges 2,500 tons during one 
 month and they end up selling 0 tons, the hedge is now pure speculation. This 
 is the main problem Eduardo is having.   We need to communicate that the risk 
 on price over the next 14 months is far more that the risk of a slight 
 shortfall in delivery over the same time period.  Which is the greater 
 speculation??
 On the ISDA, his lawyer will be arriving on Monday and we will keep on 
 working on the document next week. 
 Eduardo told me he is totally on board with this hedge  but he is trying to 
 convince Marketing to go for it (and it is giving him a hard time).
 
 We are plannig to pre-pay this swap which, considering current financial 
 circumstances, would benefit TGS greatly.
 
 Do we need to go higher up in the organization??  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jeff and Rolo
