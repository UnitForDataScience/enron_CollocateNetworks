 Calif. Regulators Raise Power Rates
 
 
 By KAREN GAUDETTE
 Associated Press Writer
 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ As protesters jeered ``Hell, no, we won't pay!''=20
 California regulators approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 perce=
 nt=20
 Tuesday to head off blackouts this summer and keep the state's two biggest=
 =20
 utilities from going under.=20
 The increases _ approved 5-0 by the Public Utilities Commission _ are the=
 =20
 biggest in California history and take effect immediately for the 25 millio=
 n=20
 people served by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Ediso=
 n=20
 Co.=20
 ``The PUC has done all it can,'' commission president Loretta Lynch said.=
 =20
 ``We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust=20
 energy prices.''=20
 The PUC also ordered the utilities to pay the state for billions of dollars=
 =20
 of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers. Just how much=20
 wasn't known; the state has not disclosed how much it has spent on various=
 =20
 long- and short-term power contracts.=20
 For the rate increase, the commission said it will create a tiered system=
 =20
 that will protect poor people and penalize customers who use the most=20
 electricity.=20
 Lynch proposed the higher rates as a way to force ``electricity hogs'' to=
 =20
 conserve and to help keep SoCal Edison and PG&E solvent.=20
 The plan is also seen as a way to protect California's budget surplus, whic=
 h=20
 is being drained of $40 million to $50 million a day as the state buys powe=
 r=20
 for the cash-strapped utilities. Since the crisis began, more than $4.2=20
 billion in taxpayer money has been spent to keep the lights on.=20
 SoCal Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last=
 =20
 summer because of high wholesale electricity prices and because California'=
 s=20
 1996 deregulation law prevents the utilities from passing those costs on to=
 =20
 their customers.=20
 Both have urged the PUC to raise rates. Following the PUC meeting, SoCal=20
 Edison said it will begin paying interest to bondholders after weeks of=20
 missing payments.=20
 The rate increase will be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent hike approv=
 ed=20
 by the PUC in January, and a 10 percent increase already scheduled for next=
 =20
 year.=20
 Ratepayers and consumer groups branded the latest plan a rip-off.=20
 ``We are being held hostage by a handful of energy companies that, under=20
 deregulation, got control of our electricity supply,'' said Harvey=20
 Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in=
 =20
 Santa Monica. ``Until our elected officials start acting to protect us, we=
 =20
 are going to be at their mercy, at the mercy of this ripoff.''=20
 Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has said that he opposes rate increases but that=
 =20
 he has no power over the PUC. However, three of the PUC members are his=20
 appointees. And his aides have told lawmakers that rates have to rise.=20
 Residents already pay about $65 per month for electricity _ 7.2 cents per=
 =20
 kilowatt hour to SoCal Edison and 6.5 cents per kwh to PG&E.=20
 The latest rate hike would mean a 42 percent increase for SoCal Edison=20
 customers and 46 percent for PG&E customers for electricity alone. Since th=
 e=20
 rates are bundled with other fees, the average price of a kilowatt hour is=
 =20
 closer to 12.5 cents for SoCal Edison customers and 10.5 cents for PG&E=20
 customers.=20
 Spokesmen for both utilities said it is impossible to calculate how much th=
 e=20
 plan will cost customers because the effects of the tiered system are not=
 =20
 known.=20
 The PUC meeting was disrupted at least five times by screaming protesters,=
 =20
 and dismay over the plan was seen elsewhere.=20
 Sam Sahouria, owner of the Fox Plaza Grocery and Deli in San Francisco, sai=
 d=20
 rate hikes could be too much for his family-run store to bear. ``It's=20
 terrible. We will probably go out of business,'' he said.=20
 Belinda Lazzerini, 40, who serves fruit smoothies at Jitters & Shakes in Sa=
 n=20
 Francisco, said her electric bills have jumped to $70 for her studio=20
 apartment.=20
 ``The Laundromat has gone up from $1.50 to $3, so now we will have to clean=
 =20
 our clothes by hand and dry them in the basement,'' she said. ``It's crazy.=
 ''=20
 The state has pledged to issue at least $10 billion in revenue bonds to buy=
 =20
 power for SoCal Edison and PG&E _ bonds that would be repaid by the=20
 utilities' customers. However, state officials have told lawmakers that sta=
 te=20
 efforts to help the utilities could hit $23 billion by 2003.=20
 California's Independent System Operator declared a Stage 2 alert Tuesday a=
 s=20
 electricity reserves dropped to about 5 percent.=20
 The alert follows two days of statewide rolling blackouts last week and two=
 =20
 others in January. ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said many power plant=
 s=20
 that use alternative sources of energy remained down, in part because haven=
 't=20
