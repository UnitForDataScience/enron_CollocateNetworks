 I had intended to call as soon as I set up another meeting in Houston but
 that had to be put off due to scheduling problems and a heavier than usual
 workload here.
 
 I would like to get together sometime after the first of the year to discuss
 some research initiatives.  I may also be interested in the position at
 Enron that you mentioned the last time we spoke.  I am currently considering
 a few new positions and would like to expand my search.  If you have an
 interest in discussing the position then just let me know.  I'll be leaving
 town on Wednesday, December 22, and returning December 29 but I am always


 
 Merry Christmas,
 Richard
