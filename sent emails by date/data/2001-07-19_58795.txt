 Jo Ann,
 As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access re-activated for the following employees:
   
    Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
    Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
    Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP     (starting in the group 7/16)
    Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
    Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
    George Howell              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time  
 
 Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,  the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.
 
 The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc,  through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,  the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC.   
 
 I hope this "pleads our case" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need additional information. 
 
 Thanks,
 Deana
