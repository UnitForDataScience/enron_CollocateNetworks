 first.  Otherwise we'll see you on the 21st.

 Gerald,
 
  I hope everything is going well in the office. The start date
 remains the same (May 21st). I wanted to know if I report to you on the
 21st, or if I need to report to Molly Magee in Human Resources for anymore
 paperwork, etc.?
 
 Talk to you soon,
 
 Majed Nachawati
