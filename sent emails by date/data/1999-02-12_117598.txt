 Brent still reports to me and I believe he should be paid from my RC.  Please 
 let me know if this causes a problem.

 Mark,
 
 Apparently there is some confusion as to who Brent Henry reports to and who's 
 RC he should be paid from.  Is he still reporting to you or should he be in 
 EI Legal?
 
 Thanks.

 Brent works for ECT legal, not EI.  He reports to Mark Taylor, an AGC in ECT 
 Legal.

 Randy/ Scott:
 
 I don't know if you remember or not, but last year I had a question as to who 
 Brent would report to and who's budget it should hit.
 He's now in Scott rc but he's a Sr. Counsel.  Shouldn't he be in Randy's rc? 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks,
 Karen
