 I am concerned about our conversation of yesterday morning.  I sent by fax
 to you all relevant documents I have concerning any South American details
 which have Ecogas involvement.  As stated over the phone and set out in the
 documents, I have never had any ownership interest in any corporation,
 partnership, joint-venture, etc. for South America relating to Ecogas.  The
 documents which you suggest you have cannot represent any such interest as
 it does not and never has existed.  I simply would not act in that manner
 and would have expected you to hold that understanding.
 
 Given the status of Ecogas' operations currently I want to suggest that we
 all direct our total efforts to resolution of that crisis, rather than
 continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jerrel
