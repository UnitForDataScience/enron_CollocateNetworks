 Tim:
 
 Please note that as of 2/13 there will still be 1,321 MWhs of Nymex Swap position in ST-PLT book (COB) which is yet to be cleared out by IT.   I have sent out an email to Norman Lee in IT and will follow up with him to make sure this problem is removed asap.  (The "unknown" position of the -311,354 MWhs showing up on 2/12 has already been taken cared of.)  
 
 Regards,
 Fran
