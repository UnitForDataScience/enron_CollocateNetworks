 Brysch is fine.  I guess he bought a boat for fishing in the Bay.  He is still in Broadband and I think is safe.  With his skills he should be one of the guys to turn out the lights if that is to happen.  Enron Sucks.  The CFO and Skilling 
 took my retirement for themselves.  I want to piss on them.
 

 
  
 
 
 Yo!    Things are OK here.   I  keep seeing your truck driving around
 here.
 Its a bummer not seeing ya'll in it.   I hope you are settling in well.
 There are new faces around here everyday.  I think this summer wil be
 pretty exciting.
 
 Take care.
