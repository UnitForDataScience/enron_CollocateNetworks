 There's a bunch of food up here today.  You might want to make the trip up 
 this way.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 Well, that way the other three lawyers at Piper Rudnick can bill their time 
 for reading the message and attachments.  By the way, Karen called me on 
 Friday regarding the "missing items" on our Ledford and Fehr Option 
 Agreements and says she will follow up on the acknowledgements and legal 
 descriptions.  I have a feeling I will need to remind her every now and then.
 
 When are you going out of town?

 She makes me crazy the way she copies three lawyers in her firm eveytime she 
 writes me. 
 
 A pet peeve!
