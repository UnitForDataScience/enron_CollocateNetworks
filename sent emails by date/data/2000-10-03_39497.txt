 As I mentioned at our last meeting, we have been working with issues of 
 electronic contracts and signatures in Global Finance, especially in the 
 development, implementation and ongoing operations of the DealBench Internet 
 site.  Vinson & Elkins has been working with us on DealBench and related 
 e-commerce matters.  Attached for your information is a V&E memorandum on 
 electronic contracts and signatures under federal, Delaware, New York, Texas 
 and certain uniform laws.  
 
 As a postscript to the meeting minutes circulated today, Enron Corp., some of 
 its affiliated entities and third parties successfully are using the 
 DealBench site for various types of transactions.  
 
 Let me know if I can help or provide additional information on any of these 
 matters.
 
 Regards, NJD
