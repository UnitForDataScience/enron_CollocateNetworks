 Changes are required to the reporting format of Enron Europe's P/L in the Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person responsible for effecting each change:
 
 Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'Enron Global Markets' heading to the 'Enron Europe' heading; 
 
 Susie Ayala: The Enron Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'Enron Europe' heading;
 
 Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading:
 	- J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 	- Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 	- For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).
