 The Energy Operations PRC meeting will be held on December 8th.  At that 
 time, I will have information for you to load for Rick's PRC meeting on the 
 12th.  I would prefer to give you that information on the 8th, rather than 
 guessing at a ranking now or taking the time of my direct reports to go 
 through this process before our meeting on December 8th.   They are all busy 
 with the details of reviewing over 400 people in preparation for our December 
 8th meeting.  Please let me know if you can make this schedule work for you.  
 Thanks. 
 
 
    
 	
 	

 	
 




  
 Sally,
 
 Attached is a spreadsheet with pull down boxes allowing you to assign 
 preliminary rankings of your people.  If you have any questions please let me 
 know.
 
 Please assign preliminary ratings and return the spreadsheet to me by close 
 of business Wednesday, November 29th.
 
 Thanks,
 Kim
