 a lot of positives to take this path. However,  there are a) pr issues and b) 
 we have hoards of on-going litigation that cost us a bundle.  We should make 
 this decision very carefully.

 It looks like my number is two or three too high.  We also had a mixup on 
 planning for the existing structuring group.  Let me know if you have any 
 questions.
 
 
 Also,  I need to talk to you about the City of Vernon.  I want to sue them.  
 Several months ago they flaked on a purchase that has cost us about 
 $10,000,0000.  Richard Sanders has done the basic legwork and it looks like 
 we have a decent case.  I talked to Chris about it, and we both agree that it 
 doesn't hurt the west business if we poke them in the eye.  They are not well 
 liked in the muni community out here, so the collateral damage should be 
 minimal.  The big question is how will this appear in the face of all of the 
 ongoing investigations?  Perhaps we should set up a call with me, you, Lavo, 
 Sanders, Calger, and Kean?  Let me know your thoughts.
