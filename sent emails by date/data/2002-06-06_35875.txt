 Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in Katy.
 
 

    
 
 Well, I don't know.  I tried emailing him but haven't gotten a response.  
 Guess he doesn't want to talk to me....
 
 Are you getting any sleep these days with the new addition?

 Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you?  If so give him a big kiss and 
 a hug from me.
