 We have a receipt from CRC at Mead to fulfill the other 25mw's.  Also we have a light load receipt at Four Corners from EPE that we are wheeling on APS transmission to fulfill the light load at Pinnacle Peak.

 This is everything for PNM.  We still need to buy 25mw heavy load at
 Pinnacle Peak.  PNM did everything else.  I will send you a complete email
 as soon as we procure the last piece.
 
 Thank you,
 Holden
