 You may want to chat with Shifali Sharma (I don't know her but will be glad 
 to call).  My guess is that many of the crude deals are brokered (maybe 
 that's why the deals originate in Houston).  I'm also forwarding to you Joe's 
 message about traders.
 
 Please call me if we need to pursue further.  SS

 Joe:  A few questions:
 
 1. Who trades this?
 2. What book does it sit in?
 3. What legal entity is that book?
 
 Please let me know as we are comparing this to another product.  Thanks.
