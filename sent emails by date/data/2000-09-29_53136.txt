 Vince,
 
 I have received the full-time offer package from Associate & Analyst Program
 last week. Apparently they have pretty tight deadlines. Because of a certain
 clause in the contract, I may have to give them an answer by October 16th.
 Since we discussed this before I left Enron, I felt it would be a good idea
 to inform you of the recent developments.
 
 I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding both part-time and
 full-time employment opportunities with the Research Group.
 
 Best,
