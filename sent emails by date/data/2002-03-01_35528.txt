 > Two quick questions:
 >
 > 1.   The Columbia Gas motion refers to two pooling agreements, the IPP
 > Service Agreement and the AS Service     Agreement.  Ms. Shemin's e mail
 > attaches a copy of a rate schedule entitled "IPP Rate Schedule
 > Interruptible  Paper Pools."   Does this rate schedule also apply to the
 AP
 > Service Agreement, or is there another rate        schedule for that
 > agreement?.
 >
 > 2.   Can Mr. McMichael swear the affidavit with respect to the pooling
 > agreements, which are with EES, not ENA?
