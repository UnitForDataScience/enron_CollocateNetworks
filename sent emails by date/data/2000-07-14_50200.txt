
 
 Dale,
 
 To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
 that Sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to 
 55,000
 with a sign-on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.
 
  I shall be in Australia next week. If you need
 any additional intervention from us, please, call Stinson.

 Dale,
 
 I was very impressed with Sharad and I think that we should consider paying 
 offering him
  o50,000. I am not sure about guaranteed bonus. What do you think?
