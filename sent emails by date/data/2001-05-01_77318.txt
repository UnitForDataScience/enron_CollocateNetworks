 p=20
 quickly, I'll have them delivered to you in plenty of time for you to send=
 =20
 the docs.  I would prefer that it work that way. =20
 
 Chris Calger is in our offices today  - a terrific break.  Now if I can jus=
 t=20
 find him.  Plus, I thought I would have him sign the escrow disbursement=20
 letter instead of Jake, since he's here.

 Kay:
 
 I agree as to the original deliverables.  However, for the GE Turbine
 Contract, an officer of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate
 (i.e., Duran, Calger or Thomas) should sign.  Just to be safe, we may also
 want the M/D of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate (i.e.,
 Duran) to sign the LLC membership certificates. =20
 
 Will you be sending the originals to me to forward to Freshfields and Paul
 Hastings?

 I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.
 
 I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
 coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

 Kay:
 
 Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
 that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
 interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
 hold
 in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
 possession
 of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
 Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
 documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
 another client most of the afternoon today).
 
 There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
 the
 retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
 advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
 receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
 about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
 on this?
