 This is very helpful. I already forwarded my resume to the Tektronix contact you told me. I am forwarding you a copy of my resume as well just in case you something good crosses your way. I appreciate your help a lot. 
 This whole thing with my company happened so fast and caught me off guard.- a lesson for next time-.
 
 Anyways please continue to keep in touch. I will do the same and keep you posted. You know we really do not want to go back home right now. I have a list of things I haven't accomplished yet.
 
 Thanks,
 Monika
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Hello Jim,
 
 I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon.
 That's great news!
 
 Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I
 would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial
 security. My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was
 bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer
 scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. 
 
 It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the
 right direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to
 have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through
 with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is
 what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in
 Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have
 great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well
 recognized for its talent pool.
 
 If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I
 really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have
 no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any
 contact in the job market I would look into that too. 
 
 Thanks Jim,
 Monika
