 Jeff   Here  goes: 
 Brownouts:    The Major disturbances and  Unusual outages report  of t he   
 US  DOE  EIA  shows 17 incidents  in
 year   2000  but none  for California.  Two  incidents were in   WSCC  
 
  
  
 On behalf of free-market loving people around the world, thank you.  I'll 
 forward later this morning or early afternoon what I've pulled together (or 
 more accurately, simply re-arranged, using the great info you forward last 
 week).  
 
 Best,
 Jeff
