 Dear Mark,
 
 I refer to my letter to you dated 31 May 2000, enclosing two originals of
 the deed of waiver between MG Trade Services AG and Enron Investments PLC.
 These two documents have to be signed by you on behalf of Enron Investments
 PLC.
 
 I would be very grateful if you could sign both originals and return them to
 me as soon as possible by courier.
 
 Thank you very much
 
 Yours sincerely
