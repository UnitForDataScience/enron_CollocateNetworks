 Dear Energy Bar Association-Houston Chapter Member:
 
 Attached is a notice of our next EBA Houston Chapter luncheon of 2001,

 Carroll, of Carroll & Gross L.L.P., joining us to share her perspectives on
 the restructuring of the Texas electric market in light of California's
 experience. This should be an interesting discussion.
 
 Please print out and return the attached notice to confirm your seat for the
