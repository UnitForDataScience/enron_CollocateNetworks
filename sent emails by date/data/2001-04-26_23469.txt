
 
 Bill, thank you for your support of the ADL event, and congratulations on the succesful completion of  your MS ride!  All the best.  Jim 
 
   so after a moments thought, I held
 out my still sweaty hand, and proudly said, "Howdy, my name's Harry
 Reasoner."
 
 Conclusion:
 
 I participated in this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and
 others who are victims of MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo
 pledges that are impossible for anyone to calculate, please send my
 secretary a check made payable to National Multiple Sclerosis Society in
 whatever amount makes you happy.  If you have not made a donation, won't you
 
 do so today? You will benefit by giving as much as the people with MS who
 need your help.  Thank you.
