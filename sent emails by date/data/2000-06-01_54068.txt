    CORNEY & BARROW, the mainly City wine bar chain, is going into the
 derivatives market. The chain is thought to be the first in the
 hospitality industry to take a position against our atrocious
 weather.
 
    Sarah Heward, the managing director, got the idea after meeting a
 bunch of customers who had just left Garban to set up their own
 business, Speedwell Weather Derivatives. About half her wine bars
 have outside terraces which have understandably not proven too
 popular of late.
    "They set me up with a hedge - my counterparty is Enron US," says
 Heward. This safeguards a modest Pounds 15,000 of turnover.
