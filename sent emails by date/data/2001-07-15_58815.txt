 ings up in typical Enron fashion.
 as any =
 one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals."  In a down market=
 , he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in =
 orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" attitude fro=
 m customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reduct=
 ions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings integrity to both =
 sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very big plus for the=
  steel industry." But integrity, another Midwest service center exec counte=
 red, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a prof=
 iteering carpetbagger, "trying to make a buck in between the producer and t=
 he user. That's all we need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to sq=
 ueeze out a few more dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have=
  to deal with it." Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, =
 indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducin=
 g new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offend=
 ed by somebody picking the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel marke=
 t in the current economy. "What do you think the mills are going to do when=
  you come to them for just the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern w=
 ould be that the price would go up on [those items]." McNeeley also questio=
 ned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. =
 "In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is a=
 ccounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment," he rel=
 ated. "Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company=
  surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distri=
 butor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?" Only just begun Questions=
  abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As =
 one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to deal wit=
 h problems?" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supp=
 lier, Dave Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficu=
 lt to implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil siz=
 es, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers=
  require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all i=
 ssues that might complicate commodity sales." Delivery is another issue. As=
  a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery,=
  but as one service center source said, "the guarantee is good when the mat=
 erial shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint=
  a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?" =
 Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. "T=
 hey see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it=
  to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research a=
 nd a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too =
 much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar =
 to the LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] t=
 o start with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don=
 't see that as the way the market will develop." McMahon has been consisten=
 t in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer=
 . The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. "We know the=
  products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill =
 or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. "It's not an 'if', it's=
  a 'when'." The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, a=
 nd what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the de=
 bate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic but=
 ton. As Don McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a sp=
 eech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and=
  he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now." =09
