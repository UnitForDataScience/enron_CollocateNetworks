 Got it, let's talk tonight.  What time is good to call you? or you give me a call!
 
  

             
    When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was
    your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with
    mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this
    week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of
    us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there
    before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went
    in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.
    I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem
    evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught
    him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive
    a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.
 
    VAL
