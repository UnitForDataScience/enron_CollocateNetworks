 California's PX and ISO, Skilling may want to consider pre-empting that 
 agenda (and most of this is not new; already included in previous messaging 
 points we've developed internally):
 
 It's the gas industry, stupidthat's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got.
 Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been 
 inflicted.
 The real answer is....(we've developed these points already).
 
 
 This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but 
 wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
