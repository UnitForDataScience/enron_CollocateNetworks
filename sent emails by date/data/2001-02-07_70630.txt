 It appears to  me that revisions were made to this agreement, and the 
 agreement was presented to the counterparty for signature without me being 
 consulted.  Perhaps you did email this to me and I can't locate the electonic 
 file.  In any event, in the future, please call me on the telephone  BEFORE 
 revisions are made to documents and presented to the counterparty.  If you 
 can't reach me by phone, send me an explanatory email. Also, please email me 
 redlines against prior drafts.  This will faciliate my review.  Faxing drafts 
 does not work for me. 
 
 I will send you the required changes tomorrow.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Kay
