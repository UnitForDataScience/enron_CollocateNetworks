 Good deal.  I think you'll like Bob but, like Dad said, don't feel
 obligated.  Don't forget to put the contracts in a folder/envelope and bring
 them along.  How many copies did you make?  I'll call the realtors and see
 about tomorrow.  Did you want to see 400 W. Alabama again?  It's usually
 open on Sunday. LU-M
