 Operator Chairman and                     Chief Executive Terry Winter will 
 hold a news conference Friday morning to announce                     a 
 possible solution to reduce the state's electricity costs. 
                     An ISO spokesman wouldn't comment on the details of the 
 news conference. 
                     According to a news release, Winter will speak about 
 "potential vehicles for containing                     costs, while 
 maintaining the ISO's high standards of reliability." 
                     The ISO controls about 75% of California's power grid and 
 real-time market. As                     already reported, the grid operator 
 has come under fire this summer for failing to                     
 immediately reduce a price cap in its real-time market. 
                     Currently, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, is 
 drafting legislation to merge the                     ISO and the state's 
 Power Exchange.
