
 
 Can you get me Julie's presentation.
 
 I'm in Toronto on April 4th and may be able to come to N.Y. However I would want to know how many meeting you would want me to attend and the message you would want sent if any.  Unfortunately, my time is unbelievably tight.  I can't assure you yet that I can make it, but I would like to try.

 Bill- 
 so far I have you set up to see Tudor, Catequil, and Global Advisors on the 29th (Thursday)..  Catequil and Global, I have the CFO's and possibly the portfolio managers... Tudor- Ospraie- the portfolio manager Dwight Anderson.
 
 Let me know if there is any problem...
 
 We still have a counterparties stuck in credit /legal...
 
 They are: 
 SAC Capital (similar to Tudor)
 Union Spring (more of a program trader)
 Renaissance (pure program trader)
 Caxton
 
 I'll try to set up appointments with these..
 
 Kind Regards,
 Caroline
