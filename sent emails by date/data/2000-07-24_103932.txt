 Susan, 
 
 We are definitely getting closer to bringing this ISDA agreement to a close. 
 I reviewed with the Calgary office the latest draft you e-mailed; listed 
 below are the remaining questions: Part 1 of the Schedule; subitem (k) with 
 reference to romanette (ix) - the term "Performance Assurance" should be 
 changed to "Eligible Credit Assurance" (same as in subitem (f) of Part 1). 
 
 Part 4 of the Schedule; subitem (h) Governing Law - question was asked about 
 Texas being the choice of law as opposed to New York. Our understanding is 
 that the ISDA was structured under the guidance of New York law and request 
 that Governing Law be changed to New York. 
 
 Paragraph 13(c)(iv), Notification Time - request that the time be changed to 
 1:00 p.m. 
 
 Paragraph 13 - the remaining issues (listed below) will be discussed by Mr. 
 Harry Wijsman in Calgary's Credit Department with Mr. Bill Bradford. These 
 same issues were discussed during the ISDA negotiations with PanCanadian 
 Petroleum and Enron's Canada office. The items are: 
 
 Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(C) - Minimum Transfer Amount
 Paragraph 13(g)(ii)(2) - Use of Posted Collateral
 Paragraph 13(m)(i) - Material Adverse Change
 Irrevocable Transfer Letter of Credit: transferability and automatic 
 extension language.
 
 Your assistance over this time period of negotiating has been appreciated 
 very much. FYI: I will be leaving for vacation on Thursday, July 20 and back 
 in the office on Wednesday, August 2. If you have any questions, please 
 contact me at 713-331-5049. 
 
 Best regards, 
 Rick
