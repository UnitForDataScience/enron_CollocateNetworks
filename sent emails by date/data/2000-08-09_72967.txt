 add generator owner's schedules and output,etc. being 
 confidential.
 
 
 In addition, there were a few things in the draft I wanted to point out, as 
 follows:
 
 In Section 2.2.3 and elsewhere in the agreement, they reserve the right to 
 make a unilateral filing with FERC to amend the agreement.  The generator 
 owner would have the right to protest the filing, but I want to check with 
 our regulatory people as to whether they can waive this right, as I don't 
 think it's fair for them to unilaterally amend it.
 
 Article 4.6 should be reviewed by technical folks.
 
 In Section 10.2.1.3, they reserve the right to file the agreement with FERC 
 even if the parties haven't agreed and executed it yet and they start service 
 under the agreement.  As noted above, it's putting your fate in FERC's hands.
 
 The indemnity of Vepco's employees and waiver of the protection of worker's 
 comp laws in Section 10.5.1 (and the reciprocal in 10.5.2) seemed strange to 
 me and I was wondering if you could run this past your risk management people.
 
 I look forward to discussing this with you further.
