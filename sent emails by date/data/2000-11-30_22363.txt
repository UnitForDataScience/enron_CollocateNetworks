 I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.  I 
 strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team 
 on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and 
 financial aspects of this project.  This is the only way to be effective. 
 Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent
 
 I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are 
 not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.
 
 Thanks
 
 Regards
 Delainey
