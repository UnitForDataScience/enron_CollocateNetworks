 I am not sure I exactly understand your question. It is possible for us to 
 sell the space if PG&E were to release it. However, I am sure PG&E has no 
 intention of letting it go as they need it for their core supplies. Also, 
 since the market value of the space is greater than what they pay us it would 
 cost them more money in the long run to get rid of it and have to buy/ ship 
 supplies under some other supply arrangement. For an answer to any legal 
 rights they have Susan Scott would be the best one to answer that. 
 Thanks.     
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
  Steve,
 
  The question has been brought up in regard to the capacity that PG&E holds 
 and it's marketability, in the event that PG &E defaults and goes into 
 bankruptcy.  Could a preauthorized temporary release of this capacity be 
 considered where performance would continue, while PG & E would retain it's 
 liability under the Firm Contracts?
 
 
  Thanks and Regards.
