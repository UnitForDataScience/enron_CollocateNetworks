 Please make sure that Paul see's the invoice.  After Paul approves it, I can sign it too.
 
 Thanks, Kim.

 Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.  
 
 I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized.  I will send an updated file if necessary.
   
 If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
