 Vince,
 
 Greetings.
 
 1.  Thanks again for hosting the dinner at Power 2000.  Congratulations
 also on a thoughtful keynote address, a copy of which I picked up on the
 way out of the Conference.
 
 2.  My family and I are leaving on a family trip 5/25 thru 6/4.  Thus, I
 would like to reschedule my proposed Houston visit, and presentation of the
 "Enterprise-Wide Risk Management" model to Enron's Research Dept., to the
 next mutually-convenient date.
 
 Best,
 Ehud
