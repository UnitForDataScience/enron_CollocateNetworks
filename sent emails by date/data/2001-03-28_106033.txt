 Thanks for the update.  No need to call back but here are my comments:
 
 Allied Waste North America - please follow up on your own as the paralegals 
 don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load
 
 FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since 
 this is also one of Sam's items
 
 City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or "Bank Ltd") -  neither of these are 
 on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish
 
 Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.  Ed Quinn is 
 leaving Enron
 
 Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
