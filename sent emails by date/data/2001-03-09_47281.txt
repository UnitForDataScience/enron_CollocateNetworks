 Hi Tana,
 
 Further to Karen Lambert's email below, could you please let me know what the 
 status is with SaskEnergy?  Are they understanding the fact that their EOL 
 transactions will fall under the Master Agreement's terms and conditions?
 
 Let me know if I need to contact them.  Thanks,
 
 Matilda
 
 
 
 


   
 
 
 SaskEnergy has a Master Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement dated July 19,1995
 executed with Enron.  With respect to EnronOnline, it is not clear which
 agreement or terms would prevail in the case of a difference between the 2
 agreements.  Could you please clairfy?
 
 I can be reached at the above email or by telephone at (306) 777-9376 or
 fax (306) 569-3522.
