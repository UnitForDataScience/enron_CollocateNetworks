 since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
 County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
 in TX.
 
 I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
 Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
 whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
 lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
 school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.
 
 What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
 do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
 questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....
 
 Hope to hear from you soon...
 
 Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
 be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)
 
 Love,
 Heather

 << I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather
 Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an
 email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori
 (Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping
 you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop
 me an email - let's catch up.
