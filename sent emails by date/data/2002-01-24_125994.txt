 Dawn,
 Is there any way that I can make a tuition reimbursement claim for the fall? The courses finished before I was let go from Enron, but I didn't receive my grades until recently. Cash is getting a bit tight these days, so I would appreciate it very much if there's anything you can do. Let me know.
