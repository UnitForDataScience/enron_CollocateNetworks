 Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.
 
 What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?
