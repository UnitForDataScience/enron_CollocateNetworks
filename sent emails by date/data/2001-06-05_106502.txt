 3:30 Thursday, Central Time happens to fall exactly to the minute on a time 
 when I have to be on the phone with Mark Haedicke and Elizabeth Sager.  I 
 cannot move that time.  Can we go earlier or move it to Friday?  I am trying 
 to get the cases to you as soon as I can.  I've scheduled 3:00 PM following today's Legal/Credit meeting.  If 
 you prefer later, please let me know.
 
 Thanks!

 with Mark Taylor for Thursday, June 7
 
 
 Does Mark have time in the afternoon to meet with me and Christian Yoder 
 (Portland - 2 hours earlier than CST)?  The topic is "Washington State 
 PUD's".  I'd schedule about an hour.  Thanks.
