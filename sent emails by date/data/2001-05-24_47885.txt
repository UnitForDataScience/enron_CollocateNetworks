 McKinney or Arfan as Agents and Attorneys-in-Fact to execute Password=20
 Applications (which is the only authority we would give them, not general=
 =20
 signing authority for any other documents).   I need to confirm whether you=
 =20
 have prepared any resolutions granting Lara & Arfan signing authority and i=
 f=20
 you have I need to get copies faxed to me.  Of course, I only care about=20
 Enron Online, the other two companies fall under your jurisdiction.
