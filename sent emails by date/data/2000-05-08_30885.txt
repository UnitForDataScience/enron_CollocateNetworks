 I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea 
 Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La 
 curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the 
 following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;

 9740
 6335
 6333

 4850
 ISRP84

 Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions.

 Imelda and Karie,
 
 The East desk traders have asked me to set up a new curve for the Sear/Sea 
 Robin Pool/ISRP zone.  The curve is already set up in Erms.  Please do your 
 sitara voodoo to map the above location to this new curve.
