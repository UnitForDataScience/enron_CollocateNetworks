 After our discussion this afternoon, I have given some additional thought  our arbitration and
 a court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim.
 Unfortunately, El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on the
 Guaranty Agreement claim.
 
 Fourth, El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentiality
 provision.  I think they would have a good argument that we have breached
 that provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc. to people outside the
 company such as our bankers.  I am not clear what damages they could claim
 based on that alleged breach.
 
 I haven't heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for El
 Paso to assert, but we haven't done much investigating in that area either.
 I suppose if El Paso got really mad, they might look back over the 
 negotiations in this deal and others to see if they have any other claims 
 they could construct.
