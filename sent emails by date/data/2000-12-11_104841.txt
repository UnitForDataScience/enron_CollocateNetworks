 Is this a request to me?

 Bruce, 
 It does not sound like we will be using the Enron Brazil Power Holdings' 
 entity any longer to hold these shares.
 We will need to know the entity and work with Legal to get the proper 
 documentation necessary to open up an account at the prime brokers. 
 Sara is legal and we work with her team to open up authorized new accounts.
 Thanks for the update.
 Sheila
 please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer 
 shares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M "unrestriction" with BONY and Skadden. 
 
 
 Regards,  Bruce
