 Can you give John a call and get him what he needs.  I don't know anything about the request.  I gave him some of ours and he needed one of yours.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol

 Anne,
 
 Can you please send John Swinney the post i.d for the "ENA-FT-WT-ENA" as of 09/28/2001.  He is fulfilling an Arthur Andersen request.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol
