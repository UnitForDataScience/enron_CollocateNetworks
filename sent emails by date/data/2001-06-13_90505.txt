 aders are working out of there house.   They have no idea what there positi=
 ons are, and they are trading almost exclusively on EOL from their home com=
 puters.

 What a joke, huh.
 
 
     
 
 I wanted to give you a quick update on this.  After reviewing the various a=
 ngles on this with structuring, it was evident that the best real prospect =
 for doing something with them was for us to receive a below mkt position fr=
 om Calpine off of Dighton (so as to force Coenergy (gas supplier) to make a=
 s large a termination pmt to Calpine as possible).  In return, we would pro=
 vide some other form of value (e.g., low cost capital to facilitate re-fina=
 ncing of Dighton once gas agreement terminated, we sell them a below mkt po=
 sition in another region, etc.).   I floated this proposal verbally to Paul=
  Barnett about a 1-1.5 weeks ago, and his reaction was sort of "that sounds=
  interesting" but he didn't show a great deal of genuine interest.  I indic=
 ated to him that I would work up a more specific written proposal.   Howeve=
 r, after discussing with our legal dept, they had some real angst of me mak=
 ing a formal written proposal to them in this regard (concerns centering ar=
 ound tortious interference, etc.).  Based on that, I called Barnett back sa=
 ying I was unable to make a formal written proposal along the lines of my v=
 erbal proposal to him, but that we would still be interested and indicated =
 that the ball is in his court if he wants to pursue that angle.  As yet I h=
 ave not heard back from him, and i do not hold a lot of hope that they want=
  to pursue this.   Kevin - please let me know if you think trying to chase =
 this more makes sense based on your discussions with Paul P. a few weeks ba=
 ck.
