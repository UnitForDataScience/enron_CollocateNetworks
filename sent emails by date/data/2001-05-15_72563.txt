 Enron, do you want war in Florida?
 
 You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
 the fuck out of South Florida!
 
 Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
 have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
 there.
 
 The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
 the edge of our National Park.
 
 We will stop you!
