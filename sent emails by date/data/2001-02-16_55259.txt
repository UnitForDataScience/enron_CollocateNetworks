 I received a number of phone messages from you.
 The project is now in the hands of John and I shall
 be very happy to assist him when he is ready to move.
 He is looking at the licensing agreement right now.
 
 Till then, I have to wait for him to make  a decision.
 My role in this project is one of a facilitator, technical
 consultant.

 Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American
 Gas Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
 familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.
 
 I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December
 and will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the
 business segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on
 the Long Term gas model.
 
 Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced
 his name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for
 now.  My apologies.
 
 Regards,
 
 John Goodpasture
