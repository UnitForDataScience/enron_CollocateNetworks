
 
 I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first 
 time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain 
 check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am 
 here early just to clean out my e-mails

 
  
 
 
 I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
 the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
 trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?
 
 Thanks.
