 John - We have not received the NDA from Jeff Gulliot.  I spoke with our
 attorney who indicated technically Enron cannot pass PurchasePooling
 information
 on to Interliant without being in violation of the proposed NDA.  He will
 modify
 the NDA to permit information to be passed to/from Interliant freely.  I
 recommend checking with your council, but our attorney recommended each of
 you
 sign NDA's.  You may reach Curtis Fox at 914 640 9000 x268 or at
