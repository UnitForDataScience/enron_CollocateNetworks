 ... enough to scare away lifelong democrats.
 
 I got your voicemail.  Thanks for following up. We would be looking for a 
 contract relationship only, not full time.
 
 
 

   
 
 Everyone at ABC has a copy of the last e-mail I sent everyone concerning
 President Bush's appearances on the morning shows tomorrow.
 
 We have a leak.
 
 I suspect someone in total innocence is forwarding my e-mails to friends
 and
 family, etc.  I need for all of you to take a very careful look at your
 forwarding lists and think about where this leak might be.  If you think
 you
 know where the leak is, please, please let me know.
 
 If we can't find it, these e-mails will cease and desist.

 P.S. In case you were wondering, yeah, ABC is not happy.
