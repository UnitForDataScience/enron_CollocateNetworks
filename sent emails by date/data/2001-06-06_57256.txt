 Please, take a look at the link to the website
 describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission
 DC line from Canada and Maine to  NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below.
 
 The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.
 
 Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. 
 
 
 Any interest?
 
 Vince
