 calls from Sheila or Gary or a counterparty, I rely upon  Lotus Notes and the 
 information is not there.  I know that everyone is working diligently to 
 satisfy the traders' requests.  The emails you are sending can be entered 
 directly into the database so that everyone can access the information.  I 
 will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature.
 
 What do you think is a reasonable date to ask Sam and Stephanie to complete 
 their review of the brokerage agreements in Lotus Notes?

 Sara, earlier this week, I asked Stephanie and Samantha to update lotus notes 
 on the brokerage agreements that we prioritized last week.  In addition to 
 lotus notes, I often send emails to the traders to keep them updated

 Paul, I tried to call you at our scheduled time but you were not available.  
 To expedite the process, let me tell you here what the outstanding issues are:
 
 
 1. Para. 15 - Can we clarify this last sentence that you put in the most 
 recent draft.  What are we meaning to say there?
 
 
 2. We feel strongly about including the limitation on liability issue.  We 
 especially want to limit any liability to punitive damages.  We think its 
 mutually beneficial.  Did you leave this out intentionally?  
 
 
 3.  Did you intentionally reject our draft confidentiality provisions?
 
 
 If you do not have time to call me today, please send back an emailed 
 response.
