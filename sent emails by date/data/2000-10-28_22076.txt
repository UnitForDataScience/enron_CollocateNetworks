 traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.  However, I 
 think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the 
 FERC that will allow the market to work.
 
 Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed 
 to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.
 
 Thanks.

 which just means more time for implementation.
