 I need to get my loan approved and my bonus in hand before I can move in,  I am anxious!  woohoo!
 
 
  
     
 Good Morning Darling,
 
 Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.
 
 Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Cara Freeland! ;)
