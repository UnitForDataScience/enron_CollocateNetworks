 Colleen,
  
 I'll get that info to you as soon as Chris Germany finishes revamping the 
 East demand worksheets.
 
 Thanks,
 Crystal
 just get me a copy once you've 
 reconstructed the spreadsheets.

 Colleen,
 
 I am unable to complete the Transport P&L for the Northeast Desk due to 
 reconstruction on the spreadsheets where I gather my demand 
 charges/reimbursements data. If you would like me to do the Transport P&L 
 without that info, just let me know and I'll get that to you as soon as 
 possible.
 
 Thanks,
 Crystal Hyde
