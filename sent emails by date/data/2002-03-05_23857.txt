 Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.
 
 Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 Let me know your comments.
 
 Thanks!
