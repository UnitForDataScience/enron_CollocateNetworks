 poor kids are freezing their butts off.  Tell them spring is just around th=
 e corneryou always rag being 3d guy on 727s, but it sounds better=
  than being co-driver on the Airbus (i.e., the "Renault of the skies").  Al=
 l you have to do is make the friendly announcement about how long the fligh=
 t will be and then sit around listening to your 8 tracks.  Adios dude.  df =

 Dude(ett)s,
 
 Well, we all made it to Crystal Lake (Chicago).  I've driven two cars 1200
 miles each in the last two weeks, but I was by myself so I could haul butt
 at least.  We're "camping" in the house since our household goods won't be
 here 'til late in the week.  It turns out that the driver is from Oklahoma,
 so he's taking a vacation on the way here.  "So I got that going for
 me...Which is nice."
 
 To answer your question Steve, I've been working for United since last June=
 .
 I got done with training and started "plumbing" on the 727asaurus last
 September out of Chicago, commuting from San Antonio.  Since we were moving
 to Chicago, I took a bid to the A-320 this month.  I'll probably go to
 training this summer sometime for that.
 
 PE, when are you moving to Houston?  I may bid a couple of overnights in OM=
 A
 to come out and see your place.
 
 Steve or Meist, let me know if you consider going to vespers this year.  I
 haven't gone back, and I wonder if it would be as good as we remember it.
 
 Carmandy, have you tried out the equipment since getting it fixed?  Did I
 tell you about Kojak's wedding?  You were the only one from the dome that
 was missing.  Let me know and I'll fill you in if I didn't, not that it was
 real exciting or anything.
 
 See you guys later,
 
 Sack
