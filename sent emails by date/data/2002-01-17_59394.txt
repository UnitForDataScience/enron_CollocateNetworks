 I put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check with John Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options books, there should be one book for both.  If you have questions about that can you please call Errol McLaughlin directly?  Those are his books and I don't know how they need to be set up.
 
 Thanks
