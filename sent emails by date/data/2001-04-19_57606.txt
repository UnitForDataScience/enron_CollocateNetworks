 this (and future air and climate change position inquiries).  Jeff - please 
 make sure you get the comments of all involved.

 All:  I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from 
 Greenpeace, if at all.  The letter is attached way at the bottom of this 
 e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what 
 was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.  I have not 
 confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it 
 was delivered.
 
 I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to 
 Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the 
 strategies we are developing.  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on 
 developing some tighter climate change and clean air "messages" that we can 
 use in multiple areas ASAP
