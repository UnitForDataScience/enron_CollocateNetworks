 I've finished my guerilla-PR-job, here are the results:
 
 Ruhrgas has invited the Nordrhein-Westfalen (region where Essen is located)
 -based correspondents of the national dailies and also the energy
 journalists of the most important business magazines.
 
 Journalists in Califonia:
 -Werner Sturbeck (FAZ - Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung)
 -Werner Jaspert (S_ddeutsche Zeitung)
 -Dr. J_rgen Frech (WAZ - Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung
 -Jochen Schuster (Focus)
 
 Journalists that had been invited but refused:
 -Dr. Andreas Wildhagen (Wirtschaftswoche)
 -Hans-Willy Bein (Financial Times Deutschland)
 -Die Welt
 
 I also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterday
 in California. So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow
 or latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for
 example WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are
 already some articles.
 
 We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those
 journalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts. Most of
 the journalists I spoke to or colleagues from the newsdesk seem to be keen to
 know what EFET has to say about the California issue!!!!!
 
 Please let me know if you need further information!
 Best regards,
