 Good morning, Rod:
 
 As you know, there is a Plan Presentation with Mr. Lay on Thursday, November 8.  FYI, Jerry Peters will be in Houston for other meetings on Thursday morning, and we are trying to determine if Jerry is expected to attend the Plan Review.  If so, I will schedule Jerry for a later flight departure from Houston that day.
 
 Please let us know your thoughts at your earliest convenience.
 
 Thanks, Rod.
