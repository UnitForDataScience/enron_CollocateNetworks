 Jeff,
 
 I hope you can help me with this.  I need to find a way to identify 
 offsetting 3rd party derivative transactions relating to the internal trades 
 done with TW for the following deals:
 
 TW RMTC QL2915.1
 TW RMTC QL2918.1
   
   
 TW RMTC QL5424.1
 TW RMTC QL5444.1
   
   
 TW RMTC QL5357.1
 TW RMTC QL5358.1
   
   
 TW RMTC QL9270.1
 TW RMTC QL9273.1
 
 Tiffany Miller identified you as the person that did this for our deals with 
 ENA earlier.  Please let me know as soon as possible, if you can help.  If 
 not, do you have any suggestions?

 Dan/Bob,
 Following my voice mail message (to Dan), I want to circle back on the 
 accounting impact of the recent internal transportation derivatives between 
 TW and RMTC.
 
 The concern that has arisen is that TW has taken the "out-of-the-money" 
 impact of these trades (approx. $27MM) to OCI while RMTC has marked the 
 "in-the-money" impact through income.
 
 TW has taken its impact to OCI because it is, on a standalone accounts basis, 
 designating these internal trades in cash flow hedge relationships.
 
 However, from an Enron consolidated financial position viewpoint, the 
 internal trades cannot be designated as hedges (and, thus, would need to be 
 reversed which would have a negative impact on earnings of $27MM).
 
 So, in order not to have this negative impact, 3rd party "offset" 
 transactions in ENA must be identified and documented as cash flow hedge 
 transactions.
 
 It may be that RMTC has already identified offsetting 3rd party derivative 
 transactions relating to the internal trades done with TW. 
 
 However, if not, we think that the best place for responsibility for getting 
 these 3rd party trades IDENTIFIED AND PROPERLY DOCUMENTED IN CASH FLOW HEDGE 
 RELATIONSHIPS is with the business unit that wanted the internal trade in the 
 first place - i.e. TW in this case.
 
 If this has not already been done, can you have someone in your shop work 
 with ENA to identify and obtain copies of sufficient 3rd party trades that 
 hedge the risk hedged by TW. Once this is accomplished, Enron Corp. 
 consolidated hedge documentation needs to be established as a matter of 
 urgency; again, we consider this responsibility is best placed in the BU 
 using the internal trade as a hedge. In this regard, Ernie (effectiveness 
 testing) and I will be available to assist with this documentation.
 
 Please do not hesitate to advise comments or questions on this matter. I am 
 preparing the FAS 133 impact 3/31 Pro-Formas based on the identification and 
 development of the consolidated hedge documentation.
