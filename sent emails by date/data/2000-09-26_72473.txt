 it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the 
 Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we 
 reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which 
 VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the "boiler plate" 
 Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined 
 scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's "to do list" 
 to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest 
 generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the 
 Enron PPA.
 
 He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the 
 Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep 
 Enron informed of the progress.
 
 In summary, VEPCO is doing the following:
 getting all stakeholders on the same page,
 finishing the Facility Study, and
 getting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.
