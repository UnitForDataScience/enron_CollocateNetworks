 >>Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm
 down
 and become steady. "Keep on singing, Michael," encouraged Karen with tears
 in
 her eyes.
 "You never know, dear, how much I love you, Please don't take my sunshine
 away-"
 As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became
 as
 smooth as a kitten's purr. "Keep on singing, Sweetheart!" "The other night,
 dear, as I lay
 sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms..."
 >>Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest,seemed to
 sweep
 over her.  "Keep on singing, Michael."  Tears had now conquered the face of
 the
 bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. "You are my sunshine, my only Sunshine.
 Please
 don't, take my sunshine away..."
 >>The next, day...the very next day...the little girl was well enough to go
 home!  Woman's Day Magazine called it "The Miracle of a Brother's Song." The
 medical staff just called it a miracle.
 Karen called it a miracle of God's love!
 
  NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. LOVE IS SO
 INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
 Life is good. Have a Wonderful Day!
 
 This is the power of prayer at work.  Let's continue to pray for
 one another.
 
 PRAYER:
 May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
 where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
 that
 are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass
 on
 the love that has been given to you. May you be content knowing that you are
 a
 child of God. Let His presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul
 the
 freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun. It is there for each and
 every
 one of you. Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer.
