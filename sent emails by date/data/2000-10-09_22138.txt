
 
 Chris, do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction, returns 
 and risk?  
 
 This will help me facilitate the process.

 Chip,
 
 PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating 
 points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 
 6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's 
 materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m 
 decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) 
 with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language 
 drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.
 
 In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional 
 equipment through West LB ASAP:
 
 6 stacks  $1,188,000
 3 Control Modules $375,000
 1 CEMS  $675,000
 4 230kv Breakers $340,000
 Total:   $2,578,000
 
 The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  
 More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are 
 minimal as follows:
 
 Now through November 1:    $257,800
 Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)
 
 Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:
 
 EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to  EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000
 EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000
 
 Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board 
 approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment 
 orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development 
 project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount 
 might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering 
 costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more 
 complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec 
 Committe meeting in November.
 
 How does this sound to you?
 
 Regards,
 
 Chris
