 cess, although the final EISB Retail Gas standards will need to be vetted b=
 y an ANSI group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other.
 
 Also, what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocol=
 s across the board?  Seems like pushing NARUC to agree that this is the rig=
 ht vehicle makes sense. =20
 
 Thanks,

 With the discussions at NERC recently to broaden their role, I think that w=
 e need to be very coordinated on our EISB message and begin to figure out h=
 ow we get AGA to work with the Retail Gas and EEI/UBR to work with the Reta=
 il Power quadrants.  Let's think about a NARUC message to drive this very q=
 uickly (maybe at the next meeting).
 
 Having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expan=
 d our policy reach.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
