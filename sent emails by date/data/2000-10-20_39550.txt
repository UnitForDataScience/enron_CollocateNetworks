 Mark:  just a "heads up" that we may be called to react to this attached 
 NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the 
 release.  H.R. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly 
 supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest 
 which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.)  
 There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.  The 
 last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only 
 obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)  The "Energy Provisions" discussed in 
 this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.  It 
 is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being 
 negotiated.
 
 Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member 
 who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in 
 the Senate.  The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.  All and all, 
 this press release is outlandish.
 
 This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.  
 Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance.  Many 
 thanks.
