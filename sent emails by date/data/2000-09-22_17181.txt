 Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner.  Things, as you 
 know, are, well, a little nuts.  It was great to meet you and I would be 
 happy to discuss opportunities.  I need to be in S.D. in the next few weeks.  
 Perhaps we could have lunch, or something, and you could fill me in on what 
 you folks do.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hi, Jeff  can be
 avoided.   I've also maintained excellent contacts with the media covering
 electricity and can help with corporate pr as well as issue communications.
 
 As you're well aware, the light won't go out on this issue for a long time
 (pun practice).
 
 Best regards,
 
 Dana
