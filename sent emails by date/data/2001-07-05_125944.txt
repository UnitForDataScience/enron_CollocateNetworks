 I think you need to do this.  They want the info today for PRC reasons.

 Hi Louise,
 
 As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.
 
 We've arranged the file in the following sorts:
 
 by team
 by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
 by Originator (sorted by value)
 Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
 Top 10 Originators- Gas
 Top 10 Originators- Power
 
 An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.
 
 We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)
 
 Please let me know if you need any additional information!
