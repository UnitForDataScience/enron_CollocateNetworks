 hi jill,
 
 ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  
 
 how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  
 
 don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  
 
 work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  
 
 hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  
 
 talk to you soon,
 cooper
 
 
   

                            
         Good morning Cooper! 
         I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still 
      refusing 
         to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
         No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are 
      in 
         town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've 
      gone 
         soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
         colder people in my life. 
         Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
         You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
         I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
         part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing 
      most 
         of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
         tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
         Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
         Jill
