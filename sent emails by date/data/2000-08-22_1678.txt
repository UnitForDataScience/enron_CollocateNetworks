 Carolyn Gilley who is a department head in our records management group has 
 hired the firm, Millican & Assoicates to come in and compile all of our 
 current and archived files into a more suitable fileplan.  Enron has given 
 permission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval from 
 each one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistants 
 in compiling this information to complete their project.  Below is a more 
 detailed letter from the firm explaining their work here.
 
 Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to complete 
 your project.
 
 Thank You,
 
 Ina Rangel
 much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 
 Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
 requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, 
 once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
 for it, and how long it must be maintained.
 
 Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an 
 imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
 then use the "imaged" document viewable from your computer as the working 
 copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
 offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 
 
 During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
 records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 
 MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
 do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an 
 interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.
 
  If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  
 Thank you.
