 Per your voice mail, I have not yet received any credit from Tracy and, 
 consequently, have not sent a master to the WAPA lawyer.  Do you want me to 
 send a "sample governmental master agreement" which would not be tailored 
 specificlally for WAPA?

 Sara -
 
 I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
 Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
 ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
 due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:
 
 1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
 2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
 with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).
 
 The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:
 

 
 Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.
