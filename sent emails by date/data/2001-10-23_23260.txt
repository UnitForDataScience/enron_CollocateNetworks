 Bruce,
 
 Herewith the bio(hagio)graphical details of Arthur Marriott QC from the
 Debevoise & Plimpton website.
 
 My experiences of Arthur Marriott QC as a presiding arbitrator are good. He
 is not a lawyer of the same calibre as Lord Mustill or Andrew Rogers QC (nor
 would he,I think,claim to be).  But he is very practical and knows what he
 is doing.  He wants to get on with things where he can. He is also quite
 adroit at managing tribunals. That is almost certainly going to prove to be
 a necessary skill with Kamal Hossain who will see his role as advocating the
 GOI's position and engineering whatever delay the GOI wants. I am hopeful
 that (eventually) Kamal Hossain will overplay his hand,which will leave
 us,in practical terms,with a Rogers-Marriott tribunal.
