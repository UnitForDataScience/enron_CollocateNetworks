                    BODY: 
 
 
                    Tom Hicks was beside himself. He couldn't sit in one 
 place. And 
                    he couldn't stand. He couldn't even bear to watch at 
 times, but 
                    the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, 
 the 
                    giant buyout firm, also couldn't afford to turn away, 
 because 
                    this deal could go either way. I'm not talking about the 
                    company's pending $ 200 million bet on an Internet outfit 
 called 
                    Teligent. That's pocket change to a business managing more 
 than 
                    $ 11 billion in assets. This was really big. This was 
 Saturday 
                    afternoons in the fall. This was perky cheerleaders flying 
                    through the air, and high-stepping marching bands. This 
 was 
                    college football. This was Texas. 
 
                    On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin, the 
 University of 
                    Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few 
 minutes on 
                    the clock at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the 
 team's 
                    newly renovated home. A win would be huge. The 
 Cornhuskers, 
                    perennial national title contenders, were big-bully 
 conference 
                    rivals and ranked third in the nation, while the young 
 Longhorns 
                    were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under 
                    second-year coach Mack Brown. Hicks is a proud and 
 generous alum 
                    (Texas Exes, they're called), and he's deep into this Hook 
 'em 
                    Horns thing. Two years ago he flew athletic director 
 DeLoss 
                    Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown 
 to 
                    Austin personally, and he regularly counsels the coach on 
                    management matters. He also advised Dodds about pricing, 
                    financing, and amenities when Texas built 66 posh private 
 suites 
                    at the stadium before last season. In October he hosted a 
                    charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous 
                    Texas-Oklahoma weekend to benefit the school's sports 
 programs. 
                    He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas 
                    Stars, but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns. 
 
                    So it's understandable that he was a bit on edge at the 
 Nebraska 
                    game, hosting a couple of dozen friends, relatives, and 
 business 
                    associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the 
 field 
                    at the Nebraska game. Wearing a Longhorn burnt-orange 
 shirt and 
                    surrounded by enough ice-cream bars and shrimp to satisfy 
 an 
                    offensive line, Hicks was anxious and animated. "Hey," he 
 yelled, 
                    "ain't this something?" 
 
                    It sure is. The University of Texas athletic program is at 
 a 
                    pretty intriguing place in college sports. With a surging 
 young 
                    football team at its core, it is one of the most 
 successful 
                    college athletic programs in the country, and I'm not just 
                    talking about wins and losses. This is a 
 multimillion-dollar 
                    enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a 
                    renegade campus outfit. College sports has been a 
 big-ticket 
                    dance for some time now, and this program is much like 
 others at 
                    the top-tier universities, but there are a couple of 
 exceptions: 
                    The folks making the moves in Austin function more like 
 CEOs than 
                    like traditional athletic directors and coaches, and 
 they're 
                    making it work. 
 
                    To determine how they do it, I went back to school this 
 fall and 
                    asked to take a close look at the books. What I found was 
 an 
                    operation that balances the athletic department's 
 educational 
                    responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the 
 costs 
                    of running a big-time athletic program are surging and 
 most 
                    college athletic programs are in the red. I found a place 
 where 
                    football pays the bills. That was no surprise, but this 
 was: 
                    Among the beneficiaries of big-time football is a women's 
 sports 
                    program that could be a model for gender equity. 
 
                    In fact, at the University of Texas, the football 
 Longhorns are 
                    Grade A cash cows. Athletics officials credit the team 
 with 
                    generating a staggering 80% of the department's $ 45.3 
 million 
                    from revenues in 1999. That's $ 36 million from tickets, 
                    individual donations, rights fees, sponsorships, hot dogs, 
 beer, 
                    and other sources. 
 
                    The athletic department operates much like a 
 self-contained 
                    corporation, separate and apart from the rest of the 
 university. 
                    It has its core business (football); various auxiliary 
 operations 
                    (other men's and women's teams); numerous revenue streams; 
                    traditional corporate functions such as finance, 
 marketing, 
                    public relations, and HR (you know it as recruiting); and 
 even 
                    sophisticated satellite officesand, well, fix the place up a bit. "When I 
 first got 
                    here in 1954, there was a broken-down old shack in the end 
                    zone," he says. "Caretaker lived there. It took a few 
 years, but 
                    we finally got it torn down." He laughed at another 
                    recollection: He couldn't understand why fans refused to 
 sit in 
                    an upper section of the stadium until he ventured up and 
                    realized that there were no bathrooms up there. 
 
                    Coach Royal doesn't much bother Dodds with advice anymore, 
 though 
                    he did mention one thing a while back: "I told him, 
 'Nothing 
                    makes Texans as happy as winning, and it's happy folks 
 that 
                    give.'" Like any good executive, Dodds listened well.
