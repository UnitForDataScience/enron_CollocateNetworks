  will seem much 
 bigger than that because it is first.
 
 He said we got stuck because we did something significant and they really 
 didn't have any process set up to handle these things.  He said the 
 compliance staff has only gotten some real analytical skills as of Nov 
 (although he mentioned outside consultants looked at our case).  We also 
 aren't being picked on.  Other people are being investigated, but we're 
 coming through first.  I asked about utility pressure.  He said he has been 
 asked about the investigation by utility people, but doesn't believe it has 
 caused any undue pressure on the PX.  He said, if they were being pressured, 
 the investigation would have been completed by now.
 
 He said that they don't want to give the matter any more significance than it 
 has, but they can't ignore it.  A 3000MW schedule over a 30 MW line just 
 can't be ignored, he said.
 
 I didn't ask him for a heads' up on the public release of the letter, but I 
 feel I can call him for updates at any time.
