 Todd is trying to reserve a large (sleeps 16 comfortably) cabin on Lake
 Travis around the 4th of July holiday.  The 4th is on a Wednesday this year
 so he'll probably reserve it through the proceeding or following weekend.
 I'm just trying to get a head count for now so anyone interested please let
 me know.
 
 We rented this place a couple years ago and had a great time.  It's located
 on the lake and has a private boat dock.  Todd will most likely have his
 boat for skiing and cruising the lake.  Other activities include Jet Ski
 rental, wind surfing rental, sun bathing, cooking out, and drinking.

 Doss,
 
 Here is information of the Lake Travis place.  I'm sure we could get a good
 size group from H-Town so let us know if you can get a reservation.
