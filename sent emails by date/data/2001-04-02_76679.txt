 I heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff.  I know that you 
 recently went through the process in connection with the Fountain Valley 
 transaction.  I'm happy to serve up those forms to Freshfields if that makes 
 it is easier for you.
 
 My number is 713 345 7566.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
