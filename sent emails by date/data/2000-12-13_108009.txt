 this weekend in so crazy.  We will have to do something really fun when you 
 get back.  where are you going for so long?  I just got out of a three hour 
 meeting.  It was so freaking boring that I wrote a long letter to my best 
 friend from college.  About 15 minutes pertained to me.  To top it off, for 
 lunch they had four sausage pizzas.  Yum.  Who the hell orders that?  
 anyway...
 write me.  I have to come pick u pa candy apple from the hyatt, but it is at 
 Yolandas desk near you.  when will you be there?  I'll come say hi!
 
 

   
 Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids 
 singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure 
 it was fun, though.  
 
 Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message.  
 I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekendso I got home and had another glass of wine!
