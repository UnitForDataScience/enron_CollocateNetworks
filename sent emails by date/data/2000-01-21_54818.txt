 Just got it this morning. An area to focus on.

 similar to 1998 conditions. Within the Rockies, supply 
 builds continue in the Powder River Basin; the new Fort Union and Thunder 
 Creek gathering systems are now delivering a total of approximately 100 MMcf 
 per day into the Rocky Mountain interstate pipeline system. Rockies 
 differentials to the Henry Hub should average $0.25 per MMBtu during February.

 As demand declines and supply builds in the Rocky Mountains, CERA expects the 
 spread between Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin prices to increase slightly, 
 but for February, Rockies heating load will likely keep the prices close. 
 Although the differential between the two basins has averaged $0.03 this 
 month and held at less than $0.05 during December, a $0.05 per MMBtu spread 
 appears likely for February. This slight increase marks only the beginning of 
 a wider divergence. CERA expects the differential between the two basins to 
 widen to over $0.15 per MMBtu this summer as San Juan prices gain support 
 from strong demand in California power markets.
