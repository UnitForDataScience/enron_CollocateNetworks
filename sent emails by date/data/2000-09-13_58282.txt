 Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
 conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
 His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
 volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
 meeting.
 
 Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
 today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
 overview of the situation as the "teacher" or "professor."  Some questions 
 that you could address would include:
 
 Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?
 
 How is the business different today?
 
 What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?
 
 I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
 before and after your keynote is that you have "been there" in the evolution 
 of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
 deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
 stress the need for new industry "best practices" (more hedging) and the 
 right public policies to deal with this issue (from "do no harm" to expanding 
 incentives in the market).
