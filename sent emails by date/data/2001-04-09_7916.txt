 regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, 
 I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our 
 commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 
 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
 meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
 yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
 our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
 Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
 Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
 Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
 this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more 
 than anything else.
