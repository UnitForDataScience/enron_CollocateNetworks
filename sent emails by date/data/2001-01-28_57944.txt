 Reverting to you after some delay, Ana, I confirm our willingness to
 provide a senior speaker. We may be able to secure a Houston-based
 corporate executive level Managing Director if you can give us the latitude
 to introduce the subject of experiences in California and lessons for the
 European power markets. This would still be a trading and wholesale
 perspective, and indeed the lessons relate partly to issues of power
 imports and exports across state boundaries. What do you think?
 Regards,
           Peter.
