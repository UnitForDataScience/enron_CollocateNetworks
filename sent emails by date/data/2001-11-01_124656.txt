 Guys,
 
 When you see Four Corners #5 come back tonight. Please use the fundies webs=
 ite to send out a message confirming it to Traders and RT. Also, you should=
  give BPA and CERS a call tonight to see if they are selling off cheap powe=
 r. Also, we are long 50mws flat at PV (see Kate's email)...The prices are $=
 27 and $37. Feel free to sell off up to HE 17 at around 39...if you can get=
  43 bal peaksell them the off peak at PV for $75...MAKE THEM WEAR IT=
 ! As an added bonus don't forget LADWP and CORAL cut us off for "credit rea=
 sons"...please treat them as you would any other non-performing counterpart=
 y...
 
 
 Finally, Services has a new deal with a cement company in NP-15. We will li=
 quidate the energy for the Services Desk RT at NP-15 +/- $2. We need to mak=
 e a buy/sell from imbalance under Services at $0 price. We then make a buy/=
 sell from Services under St-Whourly at NP-15 +/- $2. Finally we buy/sell fr=
 om/to Counterparty X under the St-Whourly book. Then we need to give Servic=
 es the swap deal # and the price. The mw values should be on Kysa's sheet. =
 If this procedure works...please send out an email detailing the procedure =
 with whatever comments are necessary when this goes physical.
 
 Have fun and good luck.
 Thanks,
 Bill
