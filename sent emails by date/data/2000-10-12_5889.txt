 be=20
 realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=
 =20
 losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=
 =20
 said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20
 Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=
 nd=20
 Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =
 Or=20
 is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =
 =20
 for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20
 =09?? Mike Engelman=20
 =09
 =09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=
 ing.=20
 When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=
 er=20
 the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=
 =20
 like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T=
 exas=20
 is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20
 Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=
 =20
 there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=
 =20
 everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=
 ng=20
 star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=
 e=20
 expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=
 e=20
 has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=
 e=20
 Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=
 =20
 all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=
 =20
 had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=
 had=20
 been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=
 on=20
 Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=
 =20
 in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=
 e=20
 of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=
 =20
 Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=
 ke=20
 his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership=
 =20
 among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20
 constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20

 =09
 =09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20
 thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is=
 =20
 the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=
 =20
 offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20
 better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=
 =20
 seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses=20
 (K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=
 .=20
 We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank
 =09
 =09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th=
 e=20
 country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i=
 n=20
 the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20
 conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=
 e=20
 when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20
 credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=
 e=20
 to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=
 =20
 this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=
 s=20
 on Saturday!  Thanks,=20
 =09?? Lane=20
 =09
 =09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=
 t=20
 more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=
 ,=20
 and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20
 there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20
 yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20
 plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20
 tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20
 anymore.=20

 =09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, =
 no-=20
 huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20
 alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo=
 r =20
 Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=
 , =20
 the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =
 =20
 did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=
  =20
 when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=
 =20
 not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20
 believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a=
 ll=20
 would  love to see a consistent running game.=20
 =09?? Brian Gannon=20
 =09
 =09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The=
 =20
 one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=
 se=20
 it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=
 =20
 using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosop=
 hy=20
 of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass."=20

 =09
 =09BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri=
 ver's=20
 seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20
 doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear=
 =20
 hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F=
 or=20
 every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal=
 l=20
 into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects o=
 f=20
 the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. =
 If=20
 UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedu=

 last year.=20
 =09?? Brad Livingston=20

 =09BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I sai=

 too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for=

 =09Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the=
 =20
 receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely=
 =20
 coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but=
 =20
 Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run=
 =20
 on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance=
 =20
 to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20
 opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel=
 y=20

 he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has=

 been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his=
 =20
 play. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible=

 Miguel McKay on the football team?=20
 =09?? Poorun Patel, Lufkin=20
 =09
 =09BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the=

 pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And=
 =20
 he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=
 d=20
 Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince=
 =20
 the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th=
 e=20
 most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's=
 =20
 position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the=

 team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU. =20

 =09
 =09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting=
 =20
 restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui=
 ts=20
 that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4=
 =20
 years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered =
 up=20
 by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the=
 =20
 next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20
 tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where=
 =20
 the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=
 =20
 guess that it has something to do with getting "senior" performance from=20
 underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I=
 =20
 don't know. What do you think?=20
 =09?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20
 =09
 =09BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t=
 he=20
 schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without=
 =20
 losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star=
 =20
 high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr=
 om=20
 then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1=
 0=20
 and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving=
 =20
 corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the=
 =20
 O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have=
 =20
 all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los=
 e=20
 two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu=
 s=20
 Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership=
 =20
 in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors=
 .=20
 =09?
 =09
 =09
 =09Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the=
 =20
 offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland=20
 Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's=
 =20
 semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final=
 =20
 game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams? =20
 =09?? Tyrance "Duke" Barnett, Garland, Texas=20
 =09
 =09BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importan=
 tly,=20
 their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack=
 =20
 Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to =
 be=20
 and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be=20
 outstanding, in my opinion.=20
 =09?
 =09
 =09
 =09Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the Q=
 B=20
 situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of t=
 he=20
 most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20
 opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps=
 =20
 in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can=
 =20
 say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would=
 =20
 not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20
 entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th=
 e=20
 level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB=
 =20
 controversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. T=
 he=20
 coaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all=
 =20
 the while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove=
 =20
 he should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's ti=

 for him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I=20

 experiment.=20
