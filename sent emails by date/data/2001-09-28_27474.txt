 The financial swap info is going out,  Frontera being the most logical first customer.
 
 Is there anything else from us that you would want?   Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera,  etc.
 
 Let me know what you think.

 Ken,
 As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.
 
 I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     
 
 The benefit in this swap would be:
 hedge against floating price
 lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
 avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.
 
 
 
 Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
 I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.
 
 Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.
 
 
 Let me know what you think,
