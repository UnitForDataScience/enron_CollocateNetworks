 	Would you be able to attend this meeting at 3:00?  I will be there ASAP (maybe at 3:00 even), but I'm meeting on the electric compression agreements at 2:00 and I think I may not be able to get to this meeting until 3:15 or 3:30.  Please let Ramona know.
 
 Thanks!
 
  
     
 I know it has been a while, but I wanted to send you the follow-up on our conversation last week, to make sure I heard everything correctly.
 
 Please let me know if the notes don't correctly reflect your memory of the conversations.  
 
 Thanks a bunch!
 
 ab.
