 gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment?
 
 It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09.

 Hello Chris,
 Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
 about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the 
 purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the 
 demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for 
 late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.
 Production month Amount
 April   $14,850.00
 May   $15,345.00
 June   $14,850.00
 July   $15,345.00
 August   $15,345.00
 Interest   $926.32

 Shawna,
 I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
 following?
 
 Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
 Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
 you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
 Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
 that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
 send this note too.  
 Thank you for your help!
