 It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing 
 Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment 
 declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let 
 me know if it works.  If so, I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it 
 at your convenience.  
 
 Thanks - Gregg
