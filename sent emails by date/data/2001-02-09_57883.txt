 Philippe,
 
 Here is an outline of the 363 numbering information we talked about, the 
 process is very complicated and may need us to set down with the senior 
 management to explain how it works and the implications, my suggestion is 
 that Ken Rice would be the best one to take it forward, as he understands the 
 market and has some profile as the head of a bandwidth / telecoms company
 
 Tony Alvarado is the lead for this one, his extension is 37801 let me know 
 how you want to proceed
