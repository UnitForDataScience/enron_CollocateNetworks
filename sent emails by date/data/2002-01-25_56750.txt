 A request for the letter of recommendation.

 Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:
 
 This student has applied for a summer internship.
 We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
 work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
 depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
 a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
 ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
 somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
 with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
 may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
 material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.
 
 
 Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
