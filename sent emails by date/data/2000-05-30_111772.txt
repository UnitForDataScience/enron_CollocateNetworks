 Carol,
 
 My tax group is fine with the below language for Part 3a.  I look forward to
 receiving the execution copies of the ISDA and Schedule.
 
 Please let me know if there are any further changes or if you have any
 questions.
 
 Thanks,

 Sandy:
 Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
 respond
 to some but not all of such comments at this point:
 
 1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
 counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.
 
 2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
 (b),
 I
 believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
 (b)(g)(ii)
 is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
 below it.
 
 3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
 from
 the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
 fulfilled
 all
 of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
 it
 (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
 it
 owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
 setoff
 rights.
 
 4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
 removal
 of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
 apply.
 
 5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
 Dollars.
 
 6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
 (ii).
 Why do you want to delete it?
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
