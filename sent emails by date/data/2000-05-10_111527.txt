 I'm waiting for Dave Forester to okay this but I have spoken with Matt 
 Goering here a few times about this and I believe he has been in contact with 
 Pruett.  I will give Pruett a call and let him know where things stand but 
 until I hear from Dave, I can't do anything.

 John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue 
 contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate 
 contract.  
 Will you please call John (704-382-4061) regardng this question?
 
 Thanks, Carol, and have a wonderful weekend.
