 that Max and his team saw that as a plus for them.  Perfect approach and 
 outcome.  
   
  
 Augustin/Jaime,
 
 I just wanted to let you know that Gordon has accepted our offer to take on 
 the new position supporting your trading organization.  He is very excited 
 and looks forward to working with you both.  
 
 We are going to work on a transition period for him.  He is currently 
 finishing a project on Paper and Pulp settlements to automate those 
 processes.  He would like to finish this process before he takes on his new 
 assignment full time.  He anticipates the completion of the automation to be 
 within the next few weeks.  In the meantime we will work on having him 
 cross-train for his new responsibilities.
 
 Please let me know of any questions that you have.
