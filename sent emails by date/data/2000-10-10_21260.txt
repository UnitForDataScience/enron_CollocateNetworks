 future do not hesitate to give me a call directly.

 In my opion this DASH did exactly what it was supposed to do - prompt a 
 dialog on whether we are getting an adequate price for this asset. My 
 understanding is that no model was built to value an alternative nor was 
 there any effort to market the company. If we want to "take the money and 
 run" (whhich in this case is probably the right decision) fine, but we should 
 know what we are leaving behind, especially given the current commodity price 
 environment.  Rick
