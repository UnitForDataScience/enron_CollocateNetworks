
 
 First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday.
 
 I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a 
 telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos 
 is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really 
 hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.  
 
 Talk to you Monday.

 Ben and Chris,
 
 Attached is the revised Exclusivity Letter Agreement, black-lined to reflect
 the changes agreed upon this afternoon.  Your timely efforts to move this
 along for approval and execution within Enron is greatly appreciated.  I
 look forward to hearing your comments soon.  Regards.
