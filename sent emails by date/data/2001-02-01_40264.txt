 terminate EPMI's participation in the PX.  I have asked Dan to get started as 
 Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today.  See attached 
 explanation.  Does EES also have a participation agreement?  And if so do we 
 also need to file a termination for EES?

 I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
 EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
 the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
 terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
 agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
 prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
 necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
 60-day notice period.
 
 I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.
