 Where does the Enron NYC office stand with get the hedge funds signed up to use EnronOnline for crude and products? Could you please give us a list of the funds and the status of each regarding EnronOnline? If there is a legal or credit problem with getting them set up would you please identify who or where that internal problem is?
