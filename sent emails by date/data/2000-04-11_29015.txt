 1.  The overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost 
 entirely by the new power plant.  At most, we could assume maybe 
 5,000-10,000/day of gas load from industrials near the airport, and another 
 X,000 from Kirtland's gas load.   This assumed load will ramp up over several 
 years (or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are) 
 and not be available immediately. 
 2.  We know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for DOE.  Its 
 probably $0.042/KWh, less 15-20% to make it attractive, or maybe $0.056, less 
 15-20%.  Either way, a low rate.  
 3.  We now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipelinecombined cycle and simple cycle?
  B.  Mid Case:
 Assume we size the power plant at 150mw (or some similar size based on a 
 turbine configuration that makes sense) and that we sell the surplus power at 
 Palo Verde prices less Albequerque-Palo Verde transmission costs.  Again, 
 assume no incremental gas load except Kirtland.  If the gas pipeline rate is 
 set at the minimum rate Enron can live with, does the power plant make enough 
 $$$ to make the project work?
  C.  Wildly Optimistic Case:
 Same as mid-case, except add Baldwin's gas load and start ramping in some 
 estimated amount of additional gas load when NM gas restructuring kicks in in 
 2003 (did I get the year right?).   Also, start ramping in some estimated 
 amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the Palo Verde spot 
 sales at whatever year NM retail electric restructuring is expected to kick 
 in.  (also 2003, I think).  With optimistic assumptions like this, does it 
 make sense?  
 
 Tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of 
 May.  Ideally, we'll have a feel for the above relationships, and the 
 transmission constraint situation, by then.  Thanks.  DF
