 I changed the performance numbers in Section 10.7 and 10.8 to reflect
 the changes requested by Lee Johnson in his 3/12 e-mail that you

      Attached please find a clean copy of the Salmon Energy Turbine
 Agreement (the second document below), which includes Lee Johnson's
 proposed changes to Section 10.7, as well as a blackline (first document
 below) showing changes to the (3/27) version you forwarded earlier
 today. I have include notes within the agreement indicationg those
 places where questions remain - e.g., how the addition of the new
 turbine affects the pricing schedule, guaranteed delivery, etc.
