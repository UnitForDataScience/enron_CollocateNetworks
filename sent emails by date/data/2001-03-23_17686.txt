 So glad to hear that you're well.  Was wondering how you were weathering the 
 tech melt down.  I'm good.  Trying to figure out how to plant 10 acres of 
 grapes on my land in Mendocino (rather have 10 acres of grapes than a place 
 in S.F., I've decidedhopefully soon.  You take care.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff-
 Haven't talked to you in a while...thanks very much
 for the vm you left a couple of weeks ago-very nice to
 hear!  How are you?  
 
 Things are much better for me.  Over the newbie hump
 at Sun.  Goood things happening in general.  Usual
 fustrations. School is fine-'cept I have to take
 dreaded sunner school.  
 Miss seeing you-how long will you be in Mexico?
