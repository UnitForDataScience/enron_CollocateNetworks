 PG&E has had a proud history of service to our state for more than a century.
 
 We at Southern California Edison continue to believe that working out a 
 comprehensive solution to our current crisis is a preferable course to take. 
 PG&E's decision today does not change our position. 
 Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International (NYSE: EIX) is a premier 
 international electric power generator, distributor and structured finance 
 provider.
