 not sure what happened.  I think I am fixing to put a whole bunch of Enron stuff on Ebay, people are making money hand over fist with this stuff.

    I saw that in USA Today as I was getting on a plane this moring.
 
    I tried to send you an email to enron.com day before yesterday and
 it
    was returned saying it didn't exist.  Curious.
 

 >>>
    Looks like due to the Enron debacle, you guys can make some
 money...On
    Ebay the cups I sent you are going for $50 and higher.  Make your
 money
    while you can.
