  Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to 
 Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee 
 covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
 Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific 
 contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I 
 think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise.

 Dan,
 
 Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
 guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
 in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
 the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  
 
 Dan,
 I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
 volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
 we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
 legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
 send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
 priortize the negotiation of this contract.
 
 Regards,
 Russell

   This draft has not been sent due to pending guaranty issues.  The attached 
 has guaranties for The Coastal Corporation and Enron Corp.  for 20mm / 30 mm 
 ( per your change) and are specific to this agreement.  Dan has advised the 
 guaranties are written for the agreement and we cannot change to include 
 other Enron Companies.  You will need to contact  Enron Corp. for a guaranty 
 to included other companies.
 
 Please let me know how you wish to proceed.  Finally, the contact on your 
 worksheet is Faye Carlin (713) 877-7133
