 My tenure at Enron is coming to an end. I am passing your data request to another person 
 and hopefully you will get some help. When can we call you next week?

 Vince - You are the greatest!  Duke was in our minds as a possible new
 sponsor but we had not figured out yet where to start.  I will talk with
 the others and we will definitely pursue this Mr.  Ladd.  I really can't
 begin to express how appreciative I am that you thought to mention this to
 him.  I am in New York right now so it will be next week before we can
 start the process.
