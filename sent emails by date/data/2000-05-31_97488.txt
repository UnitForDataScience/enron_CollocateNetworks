 Per Jeff Shankman-
 The attached document reflects the ENA Gas Risk Management & Middle Marketing 
 Groups.
 Everyone who appears on the list has a recorded line.  I am aware that all 
 tapes are destroyed 
 after a certain time period; however, it is imperative that these particular 
 tapes are never destroyed.
 
 Please archive these tapes in a secure location.

 
 Many thanks,
