 To Distribution:
 
 Recently, the insurance market has become much more restrictive with its=20
 terms and conditions and is looking for substantial rate increases,=20
 especially on property, machinery breakdown and business interruption=20
 coverages.  For example, because of market conditions and adverse loss=20
 experience, Enron=01,s deductible for certain asset classes will be increas=
 ed=20
 from $500,000 to $5,000,000 combined per incident of property damage and=20
 business interruption along with a  (quantify percentage) premium increase.=
  =20
 In the context of construction risks and the associated operation of new=20
 facilities, one of the major areas of underwriters=01, concerns are the nat=
 ure=20
 and scope warranties offered by the OEM.
 
 Underwriters are requiring their insureds [Enron] to secure warranties from=
 =20
 major equipment suppliers, especially where technology risks are involved.=
 =20
 With the increase in insurance pricing and deductibles across the board, =
 =20
 underwriters are particularly sensitive to  certain types of technology, an=
 d=20
 capacity will be severely limited or unavailable at any price if no=20
 warranties are provided.
 
 To ensure that superior, cost-effective insurance programs can be obtained=
 =20
 for our projects, it is imperative that Enron projects secure manufacturers=
 =01,=20
 warranties in the contracts negotiated with equipment suppliers and vendors=
 ..=20
 Underwriters will require genuine guarantees, not just =01&token gestures=
 =018. They=20
 will require rights of subrogation against the OEM, which means that we=20
 cannot agree to a waiver of subrogation for the benefit of  the=20
 manufacturers. It is the underwriter=01,s position that the manufacturer is=
  to=20
 take the risk for their design failure, faulty metallurgy, workmanship, and=
 =20
 unsuccessful =01&new=018 techniques and the underwriter will provide insura=
 nce for=20
 pure fortuitous loss or damage.
