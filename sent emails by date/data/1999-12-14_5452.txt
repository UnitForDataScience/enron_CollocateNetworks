 Hey Shirley,
 
 I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I am looking forward to
 Saturday night.  I don't know the specifics yet, but Chad and Matt had planned
 on going to Sierra for drinks at around 7:30.  I'll give you a call tomorrow 
 to
 let you know all of the details.
 
 See you soon.
 
 -Eric
