Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that  the families of the victims are thinking about at this time.

 We'll see you tonite for the bluegrass filming?
 
  one that loves our nation and people too
 much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
 too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
 beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.
