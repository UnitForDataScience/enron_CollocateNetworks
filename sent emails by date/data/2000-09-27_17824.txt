 Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:
 
 Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
 savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
 customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
 Credits.
 
 Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
 (per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?
 
 Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?
 
 Who could handle this issue for Diane?
 
 Thanks, KC
