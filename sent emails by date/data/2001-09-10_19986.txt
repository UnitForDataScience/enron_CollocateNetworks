 The report said DWP charged an average of $292 per megawatt hour, asking more than many private generators.
 
 It could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher.
 
 Even after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year, the DWP collected profits more than 40% higher than it claimed to have netted, records show.
 
 Overall, during the 13-month period audited, profits averaged 29%, double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving.
 
 Although Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers, Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities.
 
 One key question is whether those agencies, like private suppliers, should be forced to refund excess profits.
 
 The primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged.
 
 DWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction. But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities.
 
 The leading proponent of that course is state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).
 
 In a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month, he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are "merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies."
 
 The chairman of that committee, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead.
