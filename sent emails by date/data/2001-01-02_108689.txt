   Marcy,  
 
   Today,  Adam Plager was asked to find a space off of the 32nd floor, 
 effective Jan. 2, 2000.  
    
   As I am sending you this email, we do not know where to move him.  I have 
 contacted 
   Lorie Belsha who handles the majority of the floor planning and their are 
 no spaces to
   move him.  She advised that we look to find a space with his direct report 
 Bryan Powell 
   and asked me to contact Peggy McCurley, who then advised I talk to Cheri 
 Westbrook. 
   When talking to Cheri Westbrook, she indicated that you have some space 
 allocated 
   to you, but she was unsure if you have specific plans for them or if you 
 would have (4) 
   spaces for Adam, to accomodate his immediate need.  
 
   I will be out of the office when you are back in on Wednesday, please 
 advise Adam if 
   there is any space available.  I will call in to see if I can be of further 
 assistance in this 
   search. 
 
   To help you expedite this process when you have come back (in hopes that 
 you 
   have space available for Adam), I have attached the churn request.  You 
 will need to 
   fill in the areas that I left blank (i.e, titles for new hires, cost 
 center, TO location).  All the 
   equipment to be moved has been entered on the churn.  
 
   Additionally, when sending the request into the move-team, please say " 
 This move 
   request is for the (5) spaces reserved by Heather Choate for the January 2, 
 2001 churn".
