  the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on 
 some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley 
 Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market 
 for years).  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's 
 been such a backwater.  I am looking for some good folks.  Have  at least one 
 person who would be good at that job.  And it's not Newsome.  Please do not 
 share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too 
 free market and have argued against their "fixes").  Sorry for this scathing 
 review, but this is an important appointment.  Wendy
