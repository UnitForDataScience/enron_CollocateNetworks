 really needs is the ENA "form" of ISDA Schedule (with the utility election). 
 He will also need a "generic" Paragraph 13.  The boilerplate can be mailed.  
 Before you send, I need to chat with Mark and I'll let you know more later 
 today.  Thanks.  Sara

 I left a message for both Molly and Brad Diebner and neither has returned my 
 calls.
