 Here is the proposal from NNG on south end transportation.  Any thoughts....particularity on the one year proposal of $0.065 plus commodity and fuel?   What do you think capacity release would cost for a one year term?
  
 Thanks, Kim.
  
  
 
 

     
 
 Please see attached proposal per our discussion regarding transportation on NNG.  Please call to discuss when you have a few minutes.  I intend to be in Houston next Wednesday, if you would like to discuss in person.  Let me know if you have a few minutes and I will try and meet up with you.
