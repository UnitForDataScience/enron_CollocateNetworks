 I am curious whether you are familiar with the attached Darden school case
 on Enron... FYI.
 
 John Martin and I would really like to try to interest you in coming to
 campus sometime this fall to present a faculty seminar.  Selfishly, I would
 also like to try arrange such a visit so that I can have you present to my
 risk management class.  I called Shirley Crenshaw today, and she mentioned
 that you were on your way back from Poland, so I hope we'll be able to talk
 soon about the possibility of a visit this fall.  The best number for
 reaching me is 512-751-3709.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim Garven
