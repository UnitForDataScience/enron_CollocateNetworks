 Are you still the code of conduct person?  If not, let me know & I'll keep 
 looking.

 Debbie,
 Attached is a file containing PGE's list of counterparties.  There are a few 
 financial counterparties which I have not yet included on this list. All 
 names on the list are wholesale counterparties with which PGE trades power or 
 gas or are wholesale customers.  There are no retail customers on this list.
 
 In general, under the FERC "Code of Conduct" rules established for working 
 with affiliated companies, the unregulated entity (ECT, EPMI) can tell all to 
 the regulated entity, but the regulated entity (PGE) can share in only the 
 most general of terms. Further,  PGE conversations can not convey any 
 information which is otherwise not public about PGE's markets or customers.  
 Although the question is a good, I believe I have more to worry about when 
 talking to you than what you do when talking to me. Given that I have 
 included as complete a list as I have.
 
 Christian Yoder is the ECT lawyer who is tasked with code of conduct
 issues for ECT.  His phone number is 503-464-7845.
