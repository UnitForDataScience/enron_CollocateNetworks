 Janet and Jim,
 
 Kevin Hannon is attending a dinner and a breakfast meeting (November 8th and 
 9th) with Governor Jeb Bush in Florida.  At this meeting the Governor has 
 requested that the attendees give a three to five minute overview of their 
 company and its interests in Florida.  Kevin asked me to contact you two to 
 see if you if could please give him a brief update via email on ENA's 
 activities in Florida.
 
 Thank you,
