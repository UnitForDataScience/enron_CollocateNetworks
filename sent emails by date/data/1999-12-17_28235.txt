 questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross 
 references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA 
 going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  
 (that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF

 Attached is a revised redlined draft of the above-referenced  Agreement which 
 incorporates comments from regulatory and Mike Bryant with V&E.  We have 
 added a new Appendix 1 to cover the Assets subject to this Agreement rather 
 than refer to the Exhibit in the Purchase and Sale, as well as an exclusivity 
 provision regarding use of the Assets.  We've also added a reference to the 
 arbitration section in the event the oversight committee cannot agree to 
 changes necessary or desirable to the assets.
