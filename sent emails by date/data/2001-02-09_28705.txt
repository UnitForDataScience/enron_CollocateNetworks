
 
 Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:
 1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.
 2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planningprobably you, Susan.  For 
 now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
 Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
 and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.  
 
 Thanks.  DF
