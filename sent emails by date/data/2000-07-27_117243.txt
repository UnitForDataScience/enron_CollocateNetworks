 Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. 
 Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of 
 the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000.  This amendment would have 
 stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all 
 non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).  The amendment 
 failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.  Rep. Ken 
 Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment.  
 
 In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its 
 version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading 
 multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.
 
 Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the 
 Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the 
 bill later this week.  The Senate is still the unknown.
 
 Call me at any question - Chris
