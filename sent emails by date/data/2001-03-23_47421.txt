 There are some hanky things going on in these confirms I don't like.  I've 
 just spoken to Russell and I'm going to talk to a swap attorney and then get 
 back to you.

 Hey, Tana.  I just faxed you the new credit worksheet - it's totally 
 different.
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 Sharon,
 
 Per the email below, I looked in the financial trading agreement database and 
 saw that Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group prepared an Annex B for 
 this counterparty in January of this year.  I would just confirm that the 
 credit is the same and then use the same Annex B as before.  I am going to 
 fax the credit worksheet that Credit send Stephanie in January so you can 
 check the credit.  Below is the Annex B Stephanie prepared.
 
 
 
  
  
 Russell, sorry, I should have reviewed the entire credit sheet before 
 e-mailing you earlier, but I have a few more questions:
 
 1. What is the complete name of Slater Steel?
 2. Who is their guarantor?
 3. What does "NW" before the C$188MM under "Guarantor") mean?
 4. Cash Collateral??
 5. What are the 3rd Party debt threshold amounts (Events of Default) for each 
 of Slater's Guarantor and Enron Corp.?
 6. Is Enron Corp.'s MAC debt rating BBB-?
 7. Why is the Counterparty "X'd" under the MAC if there is a guarantor?
 
 I think that are all of the questions I have for now.  Please advise.
 
 Please note, however, that I will be away from the office next week.  Please 
 forward your comments to Linda Sietzema if you don't get them to me by today.
 
 Thanks,
 Sharon
