   this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.
 
 Provided things go according to plan, we should have "rough" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard.
