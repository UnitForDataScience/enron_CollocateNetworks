 this conv. it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade 
 financial and physical gas.  I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the 
 power group, to discuss getting a master agreement in place with EPMI to 
 trade physical power.  They are aware that Credit is working on getting them 
 some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll 
 get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval 
 from Shari). 
 
 If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate 
 it, so I'll know to look for them.  I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday, 
 so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly 
 hold things up.

 Here I am again  everything is fine 
 from our end.  What does this customer need to do to get credit?
 
 Thanks,
