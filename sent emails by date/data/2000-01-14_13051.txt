 Thanks a lot.  Michelle
 
 
 
 
 Lucy, It is Enron's Retention Policy that all audio tapes be destroyed that 
 are older than six months.  This policy was lifted when the East Power 
 Marketers had a brief inflation of electricity pricing during the summer 
 months of 1998.  That retention policy is now back into affect and therefore, 
 all audio tapes older than six months at the start of each month will be 
 physically destroyed.
 
 I understand that there is some litigation going on because of the price 
 inflation during that time frame, so I need to know what time period we 
 should keep until all litigations are completed.
 
 Please respond back as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks,
 Darren Adamik
