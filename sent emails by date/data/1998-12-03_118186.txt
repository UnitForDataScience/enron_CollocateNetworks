 We ought to investigate the possibility of having a Wikborg lawyer over every 
 afternoon, with the understanding that the Wikborg lawyer would also be 
 available to work on our stuff in the morning. This is our chance to develop 
 a relationship with a new Wikborg lawyer who could replace Jarle Erik. Please 
 confirm the dates that you will be gone. I assume that you will be back in 
 Oslo by March 1. Please co-ordinate your Houston visit with Mark Taylor. 
 Thanks!
