So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if Evan provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.  We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  
 
 It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.

 I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likely (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).
 
 Does anybody have any ideas?????
