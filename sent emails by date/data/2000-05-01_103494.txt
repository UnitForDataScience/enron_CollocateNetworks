 for the ISDA?  Sara

 Hi,
 
 We discussed closing the Cargill account yesterday possibly but you said that 
 you wanted to keep it for
 additional trades. We will leave it open as long as you need it.
 
 I talked to Bank One this morning and they said that initially only NG would 
 be traded; however,
 if you want me to talk to them about rates for doing CL trades, I will.  
 Legal should have the paperwork
 set up within the next 2 weeks.
 
 My contact at Bank One is Linda Bergdahl, 312-408-8333.
 
 Regards,
 David
