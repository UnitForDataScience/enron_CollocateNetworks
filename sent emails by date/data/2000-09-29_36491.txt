 Darron,
 
 Have you had a chance to look at this.  Dave at The New Power Group is 
 wanting his money.
 
 Thanks,

 I've attached a list of the 10 deals that I don't recognize.  I grouped them 
 in pairs because each pair has the same volume (one positive and the other 
 negative) but they have different prices.
 
 Let me know what you find out.
 
 David
