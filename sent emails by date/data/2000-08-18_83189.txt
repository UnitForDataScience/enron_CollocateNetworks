 Scott,
 I know James McCord personally.  He used to work for Coastal, as part of the 
 fuels marketing group.  I have worked with him in the past.  Do you know what 
 he is interested in?  His background at Coastal was, as I mentioned, fuels.  
 Thanks! Mariella
 ps: sorry for the horribly late reply/reaction.
