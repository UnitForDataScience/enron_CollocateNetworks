 to lift the restrictions until next week (assuming we do lift the 
 restrictions).  Any word?

 Darrell,
 
 Stella Chan's contract will conclude March 1 2001. She had shown some desire 
 to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to 
 start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she 
 has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry 
 Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set 
 a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000.
 
 This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw 
 who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to 
 be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please 
 pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the 
 next step with both individuals.
 
 Thanks
 
 
 Tony
