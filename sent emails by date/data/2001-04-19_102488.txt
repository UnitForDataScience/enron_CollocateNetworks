 This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni=
 cipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing au=
 thorization.  The answer is no.
 
 With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=
 ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=
  governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=
  commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=
 tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =
 instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=
 ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=
 oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=
 h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =
 reference thereto."
 
 Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=
 ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =
 state agencies and municipalities.
 
 With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=
  exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=
 rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=
 s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=
  rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=
 thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=
 st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=
 ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =
 but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=
  a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=
  status is lost.
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.
