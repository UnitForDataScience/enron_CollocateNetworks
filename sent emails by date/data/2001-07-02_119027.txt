 Mark,
 
 I am assuming that you are back from your London trip.
 
 Was there success in the standardization of the Tanker Freight Swap product description?
 Or was it agreed to keep the product description differentiated regionally?  
 If global standardization has been implemented, has Carlos Alatorre been notified yet about any necessary changes?  
 
 I am just checking to see where we are now to see what needs to be done next.
 
 Thanks,
 Homer
