 The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.
 
 In the Senate:
 The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonightto anybody.
 
 The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
 Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.
 
 That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.
 
 In short, little has changed since yesterday.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
