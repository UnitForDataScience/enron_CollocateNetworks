 Could you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?  Tiny is trying to complete his files.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 Kim, last year you provided me with a name/contact in your group that could help me obtain Operating Agreements for customers/interconnects in our area which we curretnly do not have on file.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated with all the happenings towards the end of the year and lost the name..  Could you please send me the name so that I can proceed with the plans of setting up a Regional master file with those agreements.. Thanks
