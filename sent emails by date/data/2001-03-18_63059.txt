 Attached is the revised Natural Gas Overview presentation you requested.  Please note on slide 15, whenever the rig and production count is altered, the Henry Hub Cash Prices do not fall within the line chart.  Please advise whether you would prefer the HHCP to adjust with the line, and if so, indicate placement since most of the dollar values are below the line.
 
 Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
 
 Thank you.
