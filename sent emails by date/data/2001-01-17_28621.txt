 could even run it with a merchant business if we firewalled the merchant 
 entity off from the ETS pipelines.  Keep me in the loop and get MKM's group 
 in at the appropriate time (far enough in advance of us submitting a bid that 
 they can opine on the valuation).  Thanks. df

 Any thoughts on the intrastate pipeline aspect??
