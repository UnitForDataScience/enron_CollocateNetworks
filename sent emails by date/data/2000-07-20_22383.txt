 I assume the memo I asked for is in hard copy on my desk.
 Thanks

  there are still several 
 other balls in the air, and we would have to catch each and every one in 
 order to have a tax-creditworthy facility.  When you look at each issue, 
 separately, it seems possible to get comfortable as to each one, but when you 
 consider that there are several such issues, and that we have to be "right" 
 each and every time, you have to lower your overall odds.  Statistically 
 speaking, if you are 80% comfortable as to each of 5 separate issues, then 
 you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5, not on 5 out of 5, but we can't lose 
 on any one issue and still qualify for credits. 
 
 Obtaining a private letter ruling from the IRS as to these issues, which is 
 our ultimate goal, would take these issues out of the air, so to speak, but 
 that's not going to happen pre-close, and no matter what assurances we might 
 get at a pre-ruling conference with the IRS, unless and until you actually 
 get the ruling, there is an element of risk that you have to assume.  For 
 that reason, the 90% probability number that I threw out at last week's 
 meeting in response to a question about what our comfort level would be if we 
 had a private letter ruling is really a red herring, because at decision 
 time, there's not going to be a ruling in hand.  
 
 As noted above, I will let you know what Bruce Lemons' view is, since he is 
 the one who will be called upon to give an opinion. Hopefully, that will be 
 later today.
