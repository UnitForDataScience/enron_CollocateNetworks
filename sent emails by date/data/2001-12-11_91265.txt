
 
 I hope we are not planning on meeting for several hours. I have another meeting scheduled starting at 10:30. Also, where are we meeting?
 
  
     
 
 I am available all day on Tuesday to discuss the above subject. We need to meet to discuss this issue from purely a ETS point of view. Please let me know your availability.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul
