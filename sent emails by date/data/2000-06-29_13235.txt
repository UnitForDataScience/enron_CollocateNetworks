 not hire lawyers without significant legal experience (i.e., more than 6 
 years) unless they have some extraordinary skills and abilities (e.g., 
 someone with lots of Enron experience).
 
 I hope that helps.

 Lexi,
 I don't think the legal department takes candidates without prior legal
 experience.  Molly, will you check with Kriste or Sharon on their policy so
 that we know for the future.
 Lexi, there may be some interest in our Program if he is interested and has
 had some type of finance experience.  Give me a copy of his resume.
 
 Thanks
