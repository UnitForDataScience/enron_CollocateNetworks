 OEX - S&P 100 Index  $610.38     OTM Credit-Spreads
 
 The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index
 of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component
 stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their
 outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is
 proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share
 price times the number of shares outstanding.
 
 OBSERVATIONS:
 
 For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded
 S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than
 options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument
 less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can
 always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.
 
 TECHNICALS:
 
 While the overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading
 range over the next few weeks, the probabilities are quite strong
 that we have reached a short-term top and the current outlook is
 somewhat unfavorable. The DOW has found some support just above a
 key level around 9085 and a close below that number confirmed by
 a S&P 500 close below 1205 would signal a more serious correction.
 The long-term pattern is in a neutral but weakening condition with
 the NYSE survey starting to slip and the NYSE momentum index at
 its worst level in years. Review the Pinnacle Hedge-Section for
 more specific technical information on the S&P 100 Index.
