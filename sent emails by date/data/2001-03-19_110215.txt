 town.  Are you around?  I may organize something, so I'll let you know.

 not back before the weekend.  Utah was great!  Tons of fresh powder and good
 weather.  Are you in town this weekend?

 Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of

 Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
 and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
 El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
 Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB
 
 If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.
