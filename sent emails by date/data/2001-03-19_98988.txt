 It is suggested that the above lawsuit be assigned to Bob Vote as its 
 practically identical to the Gene Rice matter that we are currently handling 
 together.  Like we did in that case, this matter should be tendered 
 immediately to the plaintiff's employer, Morrison Construction, whose 
 carrier, Zurich, assumed our defense and acknowledged us an additional 
 insured.
 
 It appears service occurred on 2/20/01, and that an Answer is due within 30 
 days or by 3/22/01.  Please advise - thanks-
 
 Rob
