 Suzanne,
 
 Please be advised that Kelly Lovvorn (x5-8997) will coordinate the FERC data requirements with IT personnel for the EES Systems.
 I passed on all the details regarding data specifications and a high level overview of ENAs plan.
 
 The EES data will need to be pulled from all Settlement applications which include HP9000, STAT, and Altra.  Kelly does
 have a few programming resources available in house, yet he may need to request the information from CSC.  If that is the
 case, there will be costs associated with the data pull and it will be much more difficult to validate the data.  In addition, there
 may also be timing issues (????)....
 
 I have asked Kelly to coordinate directly with you as he has questions/concerns.  You may want to check back with him in a few days to
 workout target dates for your team to actually receive the information, who he should forward info to, etc...
 
 Thanks,
 
 dg
 
 (note:  Just as an "extra" thought....as long as we Settle out of Altra/HP/Stat, all FERC data 
  requests (involving pricing w/ volumetric actuals) will need to come from those systems.)
