 Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  
 
 Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?
 
 Thanks
 Kam

 Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  
 
 Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
 MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).
 
 The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 
 
 
 
 Pls review and let's discuss....
