 WHY ARE WE STILL SLEEVING DEALS FOR BRIDGELINE.  UNLESS WE ARE GETTING COMPENSATED FOR THIS I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
 
  
    
  	   		
 
 


 
  
 
 Vlady,
 I spoke with Brad regarding the current situation.  In summary, we agreed that the present relationship between ENA and Bridgeline, allowing deals to be sleeved needs to be formally documented (satisfying legal concerns/issues) and/or trades need to be directed through EOL.  Specifically, directing trades through EOL presents problems for Bridgeline, from wide bid/ask spreads to "stagnant" market information.  (i.e. knowing that El Paso is active in the market helps them better manage/optimize their system)
