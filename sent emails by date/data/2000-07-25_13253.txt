 Dear all,
 
 As promised at today's weekly team meeting, please find attached a copy of 
 the "policies and procedures" information that was distributed yesterday to 
 MG staff.   
 We will be facilitating meetings next Thursday here at Enron House on this 
 material so as to afford MG staff an opportunity to ask questions, etc.
 
 Fiona
