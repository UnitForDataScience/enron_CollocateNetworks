 I have a straight up deal with a consultant to work for me full time at $7500/month plus approved expenses.  His scope of work is identical to Eric Raab's plus add "focus on developing the OTC market and wholesale carrier relationships that result in increasing the number of transactions and volume of traffic, particularly with buyers".  He will also focus on building direct routes, our VOIP strategy and other trading oriented transactions.
 
 He will report to me.  It is month to month, 15 days notice to terminate contract.
 
 I'd like someone to prepare a draft of this so I can review and then forward it to Mr. Omar Valdez for his review.   
 
 Thank you.
