 1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
 2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
 3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
 4. Financial only
 5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002
