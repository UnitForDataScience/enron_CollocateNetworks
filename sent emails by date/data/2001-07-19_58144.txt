  At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line=
 =20
 in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.=01; Our OSSA II (crude ex=
 ports=20
 to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely have=
 =20
 been taken out with the bomb.=01; We understand that the bomb, which had a=
 =20
 manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.=01; Th=
 e=20
 Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediate=
 =20
 threat neutralized.
 
  However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days =
 of=20
 sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will=
 =20
 notify the Enron Crisis team.
 
  We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a=
 =20
 joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano=20
 network.=01; The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start =
 to go=20
 out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary powe=
 r=20
 fuel supply.=01; I've notified all relevant government authorities of the=
 =20
 situation, and so far am getting support.=01; I've also asked the Embassy t=
 o=20
 look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result =
 of=20
 an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be=
 =20
 helpful.
 
  Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations=20
 throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to=20
 perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.=01=
 ;=20
 Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the=20
 altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.=01; We =
 will=20
 kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon=
 =20
 as our people complete the overall plan.
 
  I will keep you posted as things develop.=20
