 Kay, welcome back.  The intent is that the document package should be sent 
 together, if not immediately after delivery of Notice.  When are you 
 expecting the package to be delivered?  Can't it be this pm?  I'm reviewing 
 the notices now.
 
 By the way, who is Laurie Mahon?

 Here's a set of CA I revised docs.  If these are ok, we will get CA II lined 
 up as well.
 
  << File: Assumption with GE ack(CAEDI)rev2.DOC >>  << File: Bill of 
 salerev2.DOC >>  << File: Purchase Option Notice(CAED I)rev2.doc >> 
 
 I'm on the road tomorrow, but should be back in the office on Wednesday am.
 
 Kay
