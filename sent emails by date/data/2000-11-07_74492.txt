 You got it.  Did Gregg happen to mention which legal entity of Peoples is=
 =20
 using the confidential information?  I can call him if you want me to.
 
 I'll make the first set of changes right now and wait to hear from you abou=
 t=20
 the length of the effective period.

 Kathleen,
 Please change the first paragraph as follows:
 ENA is prepared to furnish you with certain risk analysis information which=
 =20
 is either confidential, proprietary or generally not available to the publi=
 c=20
 ("Confidential Information") in connection with ENA=01,s disclosure to PERC=
 =20
 and/or enovate for its performing independent risk analysis relating to of=
 =20
 the portfolio of enovate, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company. Suc=
 h=20
 information may include (but not be limited to) and for PERC=01,s evaluatio=
 n of=20
 daily curves such as price, basis, index, volitility and interest rates as=
 =20
 they relate to the operations of enovate, L.L.C.  As a condition to=20
 furnishing Confidential Information, PERC and ENA each agree to the followi=
 ng:
 
 As for the paragraph 7, I've asked Gregg if the disclosures will be one tim=
 e,=20
 or ongoing.  If the disclosures will be ongoing, we may want to rethink the=
 =20
 effective period to make it two years from the last disclosure.
 
 Gregg also needs a resoluting regarding signing authority, but I've left hi=
 m=20
 a voice mail asking for more information.
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Attached is a draft of the CA for Peoples based on Gregg Penman's informati=
 on=20
 below.  Gregg says he also wants some language to be included regarding aud=
 it=20
 rights.  I did not include this language because I'm not sure how to word i=
 t=20
 (and I could not find an example).
 
 By the way, I used another People's CA I got from Ed's directory as an=20
 example because it seemed to fit better than the one I got from you on Frid=
 ay.
 
 Gregg wanted some pretty specific reference to the confidential data being=
 =20
 supplied to Peoples, and most of the examples I reviewed were more general.=
  =20
 Please let me know what I need to change.
 
 Kathleen
 
 
 
 This is the example I used:
 
 
 
 

 
  
 Kathleen - As we discussed, here is a high level overview of what I am tryi=
 ng=20
 to accomplish. =20
 
 Purpose: Employees and representatives of Peoples Energy will be provided=
 =20
 information related to the operations of enovate, L.L.C. that is necessary =
 or=20
 appropriate to review the accuracy of data and verify that the operations a=
 nd=20
 controls set forth in Section VIII of the enovate, L.L.C. Risk Management=
 =20
 Policy are being properly implemented and followed.  Information may includ=
 e=20
 forward curves such as price, basis, index,volatility and interest rates to=
 =20
 the extent they relate to the operations of enovate, L.L.C.=20
 
 Restrictions:  All information provided is deemed confidential.  Informatio=
 n=20
