 Todd and Joseph,
 
 As discussed earlier, I did recall reading somewhere that grep had been 
 ported to Windows. I did some research and was able to find the Windows 
 ported version of grep. Attached you will find a compressed file that 
 contains the grep binary and source. Please let me know if I can be of any 
 further assistance. Thanks.
