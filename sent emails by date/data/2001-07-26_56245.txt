 Shirley  sent you the info about the dinner,  in case you can arrive in time
 to join us on Sunday evening. Please, let me know, so that
 I can adjust the reservation at the restaurant. 
 
 Bob Lee may be out (a possible operation).
 

 (281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting
 you on Sunday or Monday.

 Hi Vince/Shirley
 
 Is the Prediction Company still visiting this Monday 30th July?  If so I'll fly over to meet them with you.
 
 Thanks,
 Steve
