 schedule.  
 I'm glad you finally met Per.  He's been a little busy since I reorg'd the 
 group and put him in charge.  Thanks for your patience, however.

 Jeff,
 Finally spoke to Per yesterday and we agreed to have lunch on the 26th (he's
 in Houston this week and on vacation next week).  Any thoughts on my getting
 down to Houston?  Hope you are well.

 Jeff,
 Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
 Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
 recommend
 buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
 a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
 today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.
 
 Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
 have fun in London.
