 Paul,
 
 As I was preparing the petition to intervene, it occurred to me that
 information has changed.  Do you want the petition to reflect both ENRON
 ENERGY SERVICES, INC. and ENRON NORTH AMERICA.  Also, since you do not
 own LV Cogen anymore, what would you like me to put as the reasons for
 intervention for these entities.  I have attached a draft petition.  It
 needs to be filed on Wednesday.
 
 Thanks for your assistance.
 
 Bonnie
