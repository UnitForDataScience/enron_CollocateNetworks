 Kate,
 
 Regarding the Confidentiality Agreement that we need for Seminole Electric, 
 the following are the items that we would like to include:
 
 One year term
 Construction of a 500 - 1,200MW coal facility expansion to Seminole's 
 Palatka, FL power plant
 Construction of a 500 - 1,200MW coal facility at Seminole's Taylor Co., FL 
 site
 plus whatever confidentiality lingo that is normally added
 
 Let me know what I left out (David? Bruce?)
 
 Thanks,
 Mathew
