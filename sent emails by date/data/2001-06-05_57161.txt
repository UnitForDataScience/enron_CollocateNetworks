   where Tonys for director, =
 choreographer and other categories are handed out. To diehards, the PBS por=
 tion of the Tonys exceeds CBS' in that it airs without commercials and incl=
 udes behind-the-scenes interviews with directors, composers, designers and =
 others.  Hesse explained that Channel 8's pledge-drive dates were set befor=
 e the station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys.  The first hour o=
 f Sunday's show had direct links to theater talents whose work has been see=
 n and heralded in Houston.  David Woolard, nominated for best costume desig=
 n for The Rocky Horror Show, is costume designer of The Carpetbagger's Chil=
 dren, which opens Wednesday at the Alley.  Doug Besterman, a winner Sunday =
 for his orchestrations for The Producers, has done the same for the Frank (=
 Jekyll and Hyde) Wildhorn productions that have played here.  Doug Schmidt,=
  a nominee in the scenic design category for 42nd Street, was a designer fo=
 r the Alley's Civil War and A Christmas Carol.  Hesse said, "We knew by the=
  end of March" that PBS would co-host Sunday's show, and yet "the decision =
 was made to stick with the schedule in place."  Because the Tonys isn't "ow=
 ned" by PBS, it could not be used as a pledge show, although Hesse conceded=
  pledges could have been sought before and after.  "There's nothing against=
  the `rules,' " he said. "It's just been our normal method of operation her=
 e (to run the pledge drive at 7 p.m.) in terms of our prime-time evening pl=
 edge start."  In a related development, NBC affiliate KPRC will not be show=
 ing the first episode of a new comedy series bowing tonight. Kristin, starr=
 ing Kristin Chenoweth, is being pre-empted by Road to Redemption, a movie f=
 unded by the Billy Graham Crusade.  Channel 2 made a decision in March to r=
 un the movie 7-8:30 tonight, KPRC general manager Steve Wasserman said. NBC=
  has scheduled the premiere of Kristin for 7:30 p.m. and is not allowing it=
  to air later in prime time, he said. =09
