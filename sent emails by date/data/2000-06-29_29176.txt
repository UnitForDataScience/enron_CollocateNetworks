 very issues, but here's my two cents worth. 
 1.  Once we decide on an optimal forum, the key step before filing a lawsuit 
 is the assessment of our probability of successbut I think the law is on our side there.  
 3.  The tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim 
 against El Paso plays into the hands of our adversaries on the Quinque mess.  
 If so, how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros 
 and cons.  I'm glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking.  
 As usual, I'll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you 
 make a recommendation.  DF 
 
 PS:  I'm ok with the outside counsel recommendation.
