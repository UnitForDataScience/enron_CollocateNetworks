 Susan,
 
 Please see the attached file for January's production estimate.  This is 
 pretty much the final estimate except that I have calls in to Costilla &  
 Walter (Superior).  They both said that they would fax their nom once it was 
 complete.  Hopefully this will be by Monday.  If not, all of the traders have 
 reviewed the estimate and made their changes.  I feel pretty confident that 
 this is a good number.  However, if your should receive any noms before 
 Monday at noon, please update the file and send it to Carlos and Daren.
 
 Thanks and Merry Christmas to you and yours!
