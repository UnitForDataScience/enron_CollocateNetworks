 database.  This lists all the financial agreements we either have executed or 
 have drafts out to the counterparty (except Australia, which we are currently 
 loading into the database).   This database is available with view access to 
 any Enron employee.  If you have any questions about a specific entry, please 
 do not hesitate to call me (or email me!).

 I have been asked by Credit.com whether there are ISDA agreements in place 
 with the above mentioned banks (who are about to merge). I suspect the answer 
 is No but please can we find out.
 Thanks.
