 	In your last memo to the general counsel, you requested that they respond to me by last Friday with respect to updating the Enron marks.  To date,  I have only received responses from Mark Haedicke, Randy Young, and John Ale.  Would you be so kind as to remind everyone again?  Thanks for your assistance.
