 this was Tim Heizenrader's take on the error he was having with the smtp server in portland.

 Dan,
 
 Both Portland and Calgary Fundamentals groups use an smtp server located in Houston to 
 automatically (with a program) send out messages based on market data.  These messages 
 are sent to both internal (enron.com) and external (cellphones, blackberries, etc.) addresses.  
 
 Recently, some (not all) of the external messages have bounced, and Tim Heizenrader and I are
 getting a variety of error messages and its not clear exactly what the source of the problem
 is (win2k, new firewall procedures, new mail server procedures, errors in sms servers on 
 the other end).  Effectively, the problem can be in 4 areas 
 	the apps we use to send the messages
 	the smtp server
 	the enron firewall
 	the message recipient servers
 
 As usual, it seems like it may be a combination of these things.
 
 The server we are using to send these messages out is mail.ect.enron.com (which resolves 
 to dserve1.ect.enron.com).  Can you tell me if there have been any policy changes regarding
 the smtp server (dserve1.ect.enron.com) or the firewall that would affect some but not all external 
 messages?  (If so, we need to figure out a way to automatically send messages to external addresses
 that is consistent with new policies)
 
 FYI: we have been using this server for over a year and a half, but have never asked anyone 
 if we could use it, etc.  
 
 Thanks for your help
 Cooper
