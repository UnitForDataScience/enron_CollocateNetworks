 Got your message last night and since both nights work for Lisa and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky Alan.  
 
 So Alan, it's all up to you...will it be Thursday or Friday?  If you're looking for a preference from Lisa or myself I think we would both be leaning more towards Thursday.  So just shoot us all back an email and let us know when.
 
 Can't wait to catch up with you Paul.
 
 See ya this week,
 Susan
