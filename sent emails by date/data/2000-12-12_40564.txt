 billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take 
 it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will 
 take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be 
 done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the 
 year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or 
 Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.   
 Tracy has the point on this one.

 Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
 determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
 RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
 McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
 charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
 some control as to the overall status of the budget.
 
 Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?
 
 Thanks!
