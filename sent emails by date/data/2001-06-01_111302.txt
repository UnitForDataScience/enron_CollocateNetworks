 The following are my comments:
 
 1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.
 
 2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before 
 the word "change" and after the word "in".
 
 3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon 
 at the end of clause (i).
 
 4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is 
 still an open issue.
 
 5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in 
 the beginning of the Section.
 
 6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load 
 Factor.
 
 7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.
 
 8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?
 
 9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line 
 of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word 
 "this".
 
 10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I 
 will also add granting/perfection language.
 
 11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm 
 not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.
 
 12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.
 
 13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).
 
 I would add setoff language.

 Carol:
 
 I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
 long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
 form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
 your review.  
 
 Please note the following as you review:
 
 1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
 billing services   I am 
 moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
 approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...
