 update my email addresses on you guys.  Its been a strong couple of weeks for 
 the merchant storage business!  First you guys (and FERC) finally put the 
 last nail in CNG and Penn Fuels' coffins on Tioga, then old Larry,John and 
 Dill finally dust off Lodi and get going!  Wow!  I shouldn't have joined the 
 evil empire quite so fast!
 
 Seriously, congratulations on starting construction up in PA.  I ran into my 
 old law partner Hill out in DC last week and got a great update on the recent 
 battles against those drips at CNG and Penn Fuel.  Siggy, what are you going 
 to do without Carol Lynn to fight with?????  Best wishes for continued 
 success!  DF 
  Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
 "We
      expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 
 
      Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
 the Bakersfield
      area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
 expects to have
      more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
 California project
      moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 
 
      Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
 have to connect
      with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
 The combined
      Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.
