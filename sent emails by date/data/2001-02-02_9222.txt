 Sally, 
 Looks like a quality candidate.   No industry experience but plenty of good 
 background.    Let us know if you would like for our recruiters to phone 
 screen him for you and save you an investment of time.

 Gwynn,
 First I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Javier Fernandez and I am
 the Treasurer of the National Society of Hispanic MBA's Houston chapter.
 
 I had a meeting with Martha Salinas and Kornel Rost this past weekend and
 they mentioned that you are looking for bilingual MBA's to help with
 European operations.  I am attaching my resume for your review.
 
 As my resume shows, I have an MBA in International Business and am a CPA in
 the State of Texas.  I have several years experience in finance and am
 looking for something that meets my background.
 
 Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments and
 thank you very much for your time.
 
 Best Regards,
 Javier Fernandez
