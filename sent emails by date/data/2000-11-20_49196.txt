 Stinson,
 
 I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
 large
 and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
 those trade earning the half of BO spread. 
 
 I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
 are 
 ready to deliever the model V.1.
