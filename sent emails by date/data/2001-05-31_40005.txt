 Mark, we are working with Ken Raisler to evaluate these products as an 
 alternative to the other "swap" type product we talked about a few months 
 ago.  Let me know if you want to stay in the loop on this at the development 
 stage.  I  would suggest that we finalize with Raisler and then bring Carol 
 in the loop.  
 
 Thanks.

 Attached is a narrative describing some of the products offered by Enron 
 Direct USA.  We are seeking a legal opinion if these products are considered 
 Swaps in the legal sense and will require the Swap Criteria language in the 
 contract. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Chris
