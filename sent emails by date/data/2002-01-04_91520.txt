 i am playing squash at the Y at 2:30 on sunday, so maybe we could meet after i play and before you play?  i would prefer that to meeting up with you and a friend.  maybe grab some coffee?  
 
 i am part of the trading operations, so i would get sold with it and then i would have to decide if i want to be part of whatever the new organization ends up being.
