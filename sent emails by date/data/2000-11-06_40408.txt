 long term transmission.  (Morgan Stanley v. Ill. Powerand Tenaska Power v. 
 SPP).  In both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) 
 transmission service and in both cases, the ATC was insufficient to award the 
 entire request.  Transmission Providers, Ill. Power and SPP treated partial 
 service differently.  In these orders FERC holds:
 
 A transmission provider (TP) is NOT required to offer short term service in 
 response to a long term request.  Section 19.7 of the pro forma OATT only 
 obligates the TP to tell the customer how much partial Long Term service 
 could be provided.  Examples:
   a new short 
 term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.
 
 While the TP is not required to respond with short term availability in 
 response to a long term request, FERC did footnote to Ill. Power that it 
 thinks it is a helpful idea for the TP to alert the customer to what ATC is 
 available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes.
