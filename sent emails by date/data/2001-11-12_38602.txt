 We would like to claim Brent Dornier for the west when he begins his Trading Track rotation.  What are your thoughts?

 Keith Holst, from our west desk, met with Brent Dornier last week in London and Brent mentioned that he might be interested in joining the west gas trading desk.  We would like try and get him for his first Trading Track rotation.  
 
 Thanks,
 Mike Grigsby
