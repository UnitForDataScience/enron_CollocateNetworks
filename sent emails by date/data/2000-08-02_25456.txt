 Daren,
 
 This deal began in May, 2000.  I don't have a deal to book to from 12/99  - 
 04/00.  Could you please retro the deal, or please tell me whom I need to 
 speak to to clear this matter up?  Thank you for your time and patience

 Anita, 
 If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the 
 correct person.
 
 For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for 
 12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volume 
 management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the 
 volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
 Please let me know.  
 
 Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
