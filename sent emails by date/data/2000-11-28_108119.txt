 They have also to some extent investigated the possibility to list Real 
 Estate derivatives at the Exchange. The way to do this would be to construct 
 an index based on the closed deals in the real estate market. There could be

 one. Is this something we could do as well?? It would be a good instrument 
 for institutions with large real estate portfolios as well as private 
 investors (those saving for a house or the ones owning real estate).
