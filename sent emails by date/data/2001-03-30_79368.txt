
 
 All,
 
 Attached is a resume for Trevor Woods.  Trevor worked with me at HPL and 
 directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left to do the dot com 
 thing with his brother-in-law who was CEO of this company.  He is interested 
 to come back to Enron and is talking to various people around Enron.  He has 
 offer opportunities at EBS and EES and has been talking with Billy Lemmons 
 about ag.  Trevor is great and would be excellent in a Jr. commercial roll in 
 an origination type of function.  
 
 He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have an interest please 
 contact him in the near future.  
 
 Shanna can coordinate the times but i recommend him highly and he would be an 
 asset to EGM.
