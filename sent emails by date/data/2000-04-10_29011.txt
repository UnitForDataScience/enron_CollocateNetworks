 talk.  DF )by the way, whats a PAJE?  DF  
 even when they were relaying Roger Willard's 
 comments.
 
 The bottom line is that they will have a PAJE on Northern for the amount of 
 the asset  (aproximately $3.6MM), but the amount on TW (less than $.5MM) is 
 so small they will pass on it.  As I understand it, that won't preclude a 
 clean opinion on NNG this year, but the PAJE will continue in future years' 
 audits until the asset is approved for recovery in Northern's next general 
 rate case.  Therefore, if we have additional Northern PAJE's in future years, 
 the combined effect would be used to determine whether or not a clean opinion 
 would be appropriate in those years.
 
 I assume we will suffer the scarlet letter of the multi-year PAJE, rather 
 than write off the reg asset in the 1999 Brown Cover and be required to flow 
 the write-off through consolidated earnings (and internal scorekeeping) in 
 the year 2000.
