 Jeff-
 Well it has been a few weeks since we last discussed the Big Sandy
 Project, and I want to move forward based on our last
 conversation/e-mail.
 
 Specifically, I would like to formalize a more detailed interconnect
 (MSA/tap) study and associated cost estimate for Big Sandy.  I also want
 to obtain from you a timeline, including all the necessary
 documents/agreements, based on a projected Big Sandy online date of
 8/1/03.
 
 At this point, I am recommending that the Project look to TW for most if
 not all of its' natural gas requirements, and thus, the pressure
 integration issue is not relevant.
 We are simply looking for a TW tap with mainline pressure, and a TW
 constructed MSA.
 I understand the CIAC issue, and as such, the Project may elect to
 construct the MSA per TW specs, to mitigate the tax implications.
 
 Please let me know what additional information require to support this
 activity.
 Thank you in advance for your efforts in bringing this project to
 commercialization.
 
 Kirk
