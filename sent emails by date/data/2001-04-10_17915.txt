 (04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP)  Pat Wood, now head of the Texas 
 utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator. 
 Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner 
 Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price 
 restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control. Neither 
 nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate. 
 While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual 
 FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little 
 to address problems in the power markets. 
 The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price 
 controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging 
 unreasonable prices. FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and 
 reasonable'' wholesale power prices. 
 ``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said. 
 ``Politically we're getting beat up.'' 
 Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal 
 regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to 
 deal with the troubled electricity market. 
 Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power 
 prices have yet to hit consumers. In many cases state officials must still 
 give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers.
