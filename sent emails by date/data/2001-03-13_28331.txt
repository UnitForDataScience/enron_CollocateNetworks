 about the DOE situation.  He's a great guy and one of the best substantive 
 lawyers I've met.  Short bioanything you can do to give this guy a sense of what life is like at 
 DOE would be great.  I'm not sure how seriously Dave is being considered for 
 the DOE Dep. GC spot, but I know that Fred Fielding and Dick Wiley have done 
 some pushing on his behalf.  It may be that a call from you to someone out 
 there might put him over the hump.  I'll leave that for you and he to 
 discuss.  Thanks and good luck with your various adventures!  df
