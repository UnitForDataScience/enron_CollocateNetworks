 Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.
 
 Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?
 
 Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?
 
 Thanks.  Sara

 Kent,
 
 Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
 natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
 transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
 year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
 we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
 ready to transact.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
 by to help, too.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim Ward
