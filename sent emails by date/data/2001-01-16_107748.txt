 Jeff:
 
 As Brian may have told you, I am now based in London.  I remain responsible 
 for
 all BNP Paribas commodity brokerage.
 
 I am writing to inquire if Enron would be interested in comparing and 
 discussing
 its experience in commodity exchanges, electronic markets and related matters.
 As you know, the exchange (IPE/NYMEX) business is on the verge of electronic
 transformation, your views on this and associated issues would be invaluable 
 to
 us.  I have two objectives in mind for such a discussion.  Firstly, I wish to
 insure that BNP Paribas continue to provide Enron with a useful service.
 Secondly, perhaps there is potential of commercial collaboration in this area.
 Please let me know if you would be interested in a meeting.
 
 
 with best regards,
 
 Jonathan Arginteanu
