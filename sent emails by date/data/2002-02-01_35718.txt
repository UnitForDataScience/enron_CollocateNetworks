 FYI, 
 
 	demand charge =  $2.6614 per month    = $.0875 per dth 
 	and the commodity is			$.0136
 	Fuel =  2.902 % and at $2.10 = 		$.0628
 
 	100% load factor cost = 			$.1639
 
  

    
 Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. has an existing capacity release to Enron North
 America for 30,000 Dth per day. This release of Columbia Gulf FTS-1
 capacity has a term expiring on March 31, 2002.
 
 It is our understanding that Enron has not paid Columbia Gulf the November
 2001 payment or the December 2001 payment. Since Enron has defaulted on its
 post petition payment and Columbia Gas of Ohio is ultimately responsible
 for payment to Columbia Gulf, pursuant to the Columbia Gulf tariff,
 Columbia Gas of Ohio has the right to recall the capacity upon 24 hours
 notice.
 
 Columbia Gas of Ohio hereby gives notice to Enron that unless payment is
 made to Columbia Gulf by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2002 by wire
 transfer, Columbia Gas of Ohio will recall the capacity effective Tuesday,
 February 5, 2002.
 
 If you would like to discuss this matter, please give me a call at
 telephone number 614-460-4996.
