 Sam,
 
 Attached is a tech corner article on the british pound sterling for the next 
 issue of the weekly newsletter.  I will be out of the office on Friday Sept 
 1st.  If you have any questions or issues to address with the article, please 
 refer to Maureen Raymond Castaneda or Yana Kristal in my absense.  Thanks.
 
 Gwyn
