 (1) the date of such rejection; or
 
 (2) the date or dates of such liquidation, termination, or acceleration
 unless:
 
      (A)  there are not any commercially reasonable determinants of value
 as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant,
 stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
 participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
 or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest subsequent
 date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of
 value; or
 
      (B) there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in
 which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial
 institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial
 participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant
 shall measure damages as of the earliest date or dates after, or the latest
 date or dates before, such date or dates on which there are commercially
 reasonable determinants of value.
 
 For the purposes of subsection (2), if damages are not measured as of the
 date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee
 challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract
 merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency,
 repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement
 participant, or swap participant,  such forward contract merchant,
 stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
 participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
 or swap participant has the burden of proving that there were no
 commercially reasonable determinants of value or no determinants of value
 as of such date or dates.
 
 
 Legislative History:
 
 
 
 Section 910 adds a new section 562 to the Bankruptcy Code providing that
 damages under any swap agreement, securities contract, forward contract,
 commodity contract, repurchase agreement or master netting agreement will
 be calculated as of the earlier of (i) the date of rejection of such
 agreement by a trustee or (ii) the date or dates of liquidation,
 termination or acceleration of such contract or agreement.  Section 562
 provides an exception to the rule in (ii) if there are no commercially
 reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates,  in which case
 damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates
 after such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable
 determinants of value, or if there are no determinants of value as of such
 date or dates, in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest
 subsequent date or dates after such date or dates or the latest date or
 dates before such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable
 determinants of value.  Although it is expected that in most circumstances
 damages would be measured as of the date or dates of liquidation,
 termination or acceleration, in certain unusual circumstances, such as
 dysfunctional markets or liquidation of very large portfolios, there may be
 no commercially reasonable determinants of value, and in other unusual
 circumstances, such as war conditions, there may be no determinants of
 value whatsoever.  Measuring damages as of a date or dates before the date
 of liquidation, termination or acceleration will occur in very unusual
 circumstances.  An example was the need to use the most recent available
 information for the Kuwaiti Dinar after the virtual disappearance of the
 currency after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
 
 The non-bankrupt party is not given unlimited discretion to determine the
 date as of which damages are to be measured.  Instead, its actions are
 circumscribed unless there are no "commercially reasonable" determinants of
 value (or no determinants of value whatsoever) for it to measure damages on
 the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration.  The
 references to "commercially reasonable" are intended to reflect existing
 state law standards relating to a creditor's actions in determining
 damages.  New section 562 provides that if damages are not measured as of
 the date or dates or liquidation, termination or acceleration and the
 trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward
 contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing
 agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement
 participant, or swap participant, such forward contract merchant,
 stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
 participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
 or swap participant has the burden of proving the absence of any
 commercially reasonable determinants of value or any determinants of value,
 as the case may be.
 
 New section 562 is not intended to have any impact on the determination
 under the Bankruptcy Code of the timing of damages for contracts and
 agreements other than those specified in section 562.  Also, section 562
 does not apply to proceedings under the FDIA, and it is not intended that
 Section 562 have any impact on the interpretation of the provisions of the
 FDIA relating to timing of damages in respect of QFCs or other contracts.
