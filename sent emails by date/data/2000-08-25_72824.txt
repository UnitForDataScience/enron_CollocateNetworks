 ENA and its affiliates have contractual rights to numerous turbines, several 
 of which can satisfy the technical and scheduling requirements of this 
 project, and some of which are already manufactured.  In the case of turbines 
 still in the manufacturing process, ENA has firm commitments for delivery, 
 backed by liquidated damages clauses and other financial incentives.
 
 
 
 
 
 








 
  
 I have received material from Reagan in response to Question No. 5
 nothing substantive.
 
 Question:  Do you need us to set up "Edgecombe Development Co., LLC" here as
 a NC LLC?  Just let me know.  We have some folks that can do that for you
 quite efficiently.
 
 Look forward to your comments.  Thank you.
