 What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
 were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
 the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
 through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
 to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

 It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our 
 discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as 
 an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors.
 
 I look forward to speaking with you soon.
