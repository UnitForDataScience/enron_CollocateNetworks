     Hi Michelle;
  
 Dovie told me that she has had a chat with you regarding the diversity stats we were preparing for the VP PRC on 23 July.  Delainey had asked specifically for these stats, and that's why wewere including them.  Is there any way that we can provide the data, perhaps marking it attny privilidge?  If not, can we discuss this with Delainey so that he is aware of the reasons PEP PRC cannot provide it?  I'd apprecuate your thoughts.  Thanks, Gina
