 The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 
 
 How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
 We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?
 
 Thanks: John Buchanan
