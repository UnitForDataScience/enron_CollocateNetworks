
 
 Here's the correspondence between Evelyn in the Houston Confirms group and 
 Paul Callahan at Bloomberg outlining the broker's new $15-per-trade fee. 
 Please let me know if you have questions or would like me to talk to someone 
 at Bloomberg about this. I'll also check with Tim to find out if the fee 
 change was ever negotiated with Enron.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
