 bank listed below.  There is no CSA.  Angela can help you with the choices.  
 THIS IS A DEAL SPECIFIC ISDA SCHEDULE and not for general use.
 
 Angela:  I know that this Schedule will never be accepted in total but it 
 highlights the ENA priorities.  You can forward to the Rabobank person who 
 sent the email request the other day and David Barbour et al.  I would 
 appreciate if you could handle and I'll let you know when I'm back in the 
 office for good.
 
 Thank you both.  Sara

 Tanya:
 
 Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
 2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
 swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
 the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion 
 which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
 format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
 a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
 Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
 add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
 probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
 as much as possible.  
 
 Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
 Friday.  Thanks.  Sara
