 are in the miiddle of a rush with Financial Power counterparties in need 
 immediate assistance (many of them govt'ls which are demanding my attention) 
 and structured financing w/swaps in the middle and I'm just putting out 
 fires.  That master is really not a priority at all for ENA, and it is only 
 Enron.Credit.com wanting to mirror it that is giving it any priority.  What 
 is your proposed timing for a deal on that one?

 Tanna,
 
 Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If you
 could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being put in
 place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick request and
 that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have spoken to
 Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC Schedule with you
 in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing EnronCredit.com's
 negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this negotiation stands and
 how long before it is likely to be finalised?
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Clare Godson
