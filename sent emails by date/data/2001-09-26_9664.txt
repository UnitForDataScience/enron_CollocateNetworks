 nd power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I=
  would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be conside=
 red in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing f=
 ees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - s=
 hould be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit spon=
 sor and ENW agree upon. =20
 
 While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still=
  have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship be=
 tween the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the E=
 OL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then wheneve=
 r John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad ho=
 c analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and pric=
 e accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader=
  requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether th=
 e request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get m=
 e and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envel=
 ope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting =
 and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly wor=
 k every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insu=
 re success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back=
  too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully ded=
 icated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.=
   It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've manage=
 d operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was=
  to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make su=
 re that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very =
 motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewe=
 d as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work har=
 d to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it=
  is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contribut=
 or to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly becaus=
 e they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, =
 nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their busi=
 ness in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you k=
 ind of wonder...=20
 
 I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with=
  a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took thi=
 s role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of cir=
 cumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the servi=
 ce provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lowe=
 r costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, bu=
 t going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  =
