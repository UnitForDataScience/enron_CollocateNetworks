 Peggy, we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC
 bid for the Cayote II Project.  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of
 the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because
 PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators.
 
 Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even 
 participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron.  It 
 seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning 
 competitive bid.  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this 
 process?
 
 Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely 
 necessary.  Thanks for your help.
