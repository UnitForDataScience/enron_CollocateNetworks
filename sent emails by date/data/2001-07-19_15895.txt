 In the Senate:
 After Burton's "proclamation" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was 
 "all Edison was getting, period," the bill was voted down in committee and 
 never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
 The bill will be "reconsidered" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same 
 committee.  
 
 In the Assembly:
 Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched 
 his vote and let it get out.
 82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and 
 now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
 83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted 
 out of committee and will go to appropriations today.
 
 Will report back later this AM with any additional information.

 to anybody.
 
 The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
 Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); 
 the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
 they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.
 
 That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
 down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
 talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
 Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.
 
 In short, little has changed since yesterday.

 Jeff
