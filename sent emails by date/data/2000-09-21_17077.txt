 since Mr. Filner is on a mission to tan a few hides over the price spikes in 
 S.D.  At congressional and FERC hearings in S.D. last week, Mr. Filner called 
 generators and marketers quite a few ugly names, fingered them as the cause 
 for the high prices, and demanded that Congress and FERC make them give all 
 the money back to S.D. consumers.  Fairly sensitive item, to put it mildly.  
 I'm at 415.782.7822.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Gentlemen:
 
 Steve asked that I follow up with you on the inquiry below.  I met with Bob 
 Filner, US Representative from San Diego , who had asked that I forward any 
 information to him about Enron's management of energy prices.  Could you 
 recommend how we can follow up with him.  I am happy to direct him towards 
 you.
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Michael
  they will in turn follow-up, .
 
 Best to you and the family. Drop by sometime,. I am in room 1212.

 Hello Chris:
 
 I hope you and your family are doing well.  I am sorry to have fallen out of 
 touch.
 
 I was thinking of you recently wen speaking with a Congressional 
 representative from San Diego.  After a summer of rolling brown outs and  
 increasing prices from the utilities, he was searching for an energy 
 solution.  Who would be the best contact within EES or ENA to explore the 
 possibilities for the city of San Diego?
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Best regards,
 Michael
