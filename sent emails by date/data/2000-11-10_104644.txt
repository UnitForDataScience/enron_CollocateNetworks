 Dear Paul,
 
 I have just found out that we will be doing back to back trades for other 
 Enron companies with IBJ.  IBJ has already been talking with UK and US Enron 
 entities re pulp, lumber and oil trading but wants to have its ISDA with a 
 Japanese Enron company so we are negotiating it.
 
 What information do I need to give you so that you can check whether we are 
 authorized to do such trades?
