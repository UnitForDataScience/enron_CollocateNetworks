 Please email the names of any financial counterparties which you have revie=
 wed on behalf of global markets to Susan, Stephanie and Samantha.  Such cou=
 nterparties may have been previously reviewed for a different financial pro=
 duct and we do not want to create multiple files or conduct multiple review=
 s.
 
 Bob Sevitz is the "gatekeeper" for the data collection process.
 
 Thanks.
