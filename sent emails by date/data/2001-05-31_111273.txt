 Looks like we sent them a draft EEI Cover Sheet earlier this year.  
 
 Genia, Can you e-mail that draft to Wendy?

 Carol,
 
 I think we would like to push for an EEI with Morgan.  I will send up a 
 credit worksheet ASAP.

 Wendy:
 Have you had a chance to take a look at this and if so, do you have any 
 credit issues with this assignment?
