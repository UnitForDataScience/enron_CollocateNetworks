
 
 There are a few other issues we need to look into:
 
 Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
 price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
 

 
 









    
 For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
 issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
 comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
 already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
 to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
 cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
 haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.
