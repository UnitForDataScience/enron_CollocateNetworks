 Gentlemen, Michelle Cash in Legal has reviewed the engineering advertisement
 
 that we put together for campus and had the comments below.  Michelle is
 concerned about how much we tie Enron into the document.
 
 I revised the document as Michelle suggested, see engradv3.  It does not
 have
 quite the flow that the preceding document had.
 
 Let's discuss this document next week when we are all in New Jersey.  David,
 you
 might want to talk to Michelle about the bigger issue of keeping Enron's
 name
 separate from GSP, her phone number is 853.6401

      I believe the attached document is the final version for the process
      engineering position. Please review it. If it looks OK I would like to
      send it off to Syracuse to be posted in the Pulp and Paper Science
      Department. I will schedule a recruiting trip there in November.
 
      Is anyone going to Maine or Rutgers/NJIT?
 
      Dave
