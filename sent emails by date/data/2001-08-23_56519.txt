 I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
 would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
 Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
 of his associates.
 
 Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

 Hi Michael
 
 Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
 Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
 ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
 of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
 that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
 for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
 Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
 the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
 still be there but we can try.
 
 Thanks-
 Amy Richard
