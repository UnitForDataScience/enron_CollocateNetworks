 Causey left me a voice mail message on Sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all EEL reviews at present.  Still waiting on Buy.  I will find him today.  
 
  
     
 James,
 
 Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.
 
 Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.
 
 Stacey
