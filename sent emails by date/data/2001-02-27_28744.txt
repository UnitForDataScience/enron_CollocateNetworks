 Jeff,
 
 As we talk this morning we are interested on developing a new project
 with your company that could take gas into EPNG=01,s Hueco compressor
 station located in Hudspeth County, Texas.
 
 The preliminary information we can give you in order to move forward
 with the project is this:
 
 Receipt point:                            Transwestern and NNG
 Delivery point-                            Hueco Compress Station
 Delivery Pressure-                      840 psi
 Volume                                     100,150 and 200 MMBTU/day
 Term                                         10,15 and 20 years.
 
 
 The information we would like to receive from you is:
 
 1.         Permissions you will need to get in order to build the
 interconnection FERC, RRC, EPNG, others (timing for those permissions)
 2.         Time to build the interconnection
 3.         As we understand, you as interstate pipeline need to post the
 capacity at the EBB, how much time would it take?
 4.         Rates and fuel charges that apply for all your system
 (Transwestern and NNG)
 5.         Estimated cost for the new interconnection facilities.
 6.         Supply areas that we can access
 7.         Storage Facilities
 
 
 We hope that with this information you can run your first numbers about
 how we can make this project work and we can have some distance walked
 for our upcoming meeting on march 9th, 2001
 
 Thank you in advance for the help and if you have any question don=01,t
 hesitate to give me a call.
 
 Sincerely yours=01(
