 Dear Seyi:
 
 I am sending a copy of the fax sent to you earlier this day.  The attachment 
 is
 a Word 97 document.  Please let me know if you have trouble opening it.
 
 Incidentally, I have had the pleasure of working with you in the past.  Tim
 Archer and I met with you a number of years ago regarding the establishment of
 an indigenous company which was to provide assistance to M-I Nigeria on 
 various
 levels.  I look forward to working with you again.
 
 
 
 James MacCallon
