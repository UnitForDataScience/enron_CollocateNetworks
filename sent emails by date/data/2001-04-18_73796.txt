
 
 Good timing.
 
 You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added 
 to the "employee/consultant" form.  Could you email me the topics so that I 
 can take a look and make changes.  Once again I expect to be on an endless 
 conference call, but I can work while I talk.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
