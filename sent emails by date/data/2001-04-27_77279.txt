 Kay, was Dale to make the change Lee has listed below.  If yes, it was not 
 Done.  Tom Constantine has been working the drafts for Dale.  Can I get Tom 
 to make the change, resend back out as the final and get to Lee Johnson as

  GE for MCS as EPC for LVCII.
 
 
 Hello Lee.  (I know your thinking - What now!)
 
 As I'm sure you know, we are fast approaching a full notice to proceed on
 the LVCII project.  One item that we have as part of our EPC contract with
 Modern Continental South, is an Assignment and Assumption Agreement whereby
 MCS will assume certain responsibilities for (owner), and abide by the
 conditions set forth in that agreement.  We will ask GE to participate in
 that Agreement.  I have attached that agreement to this e mail for your
 review.  Current plans are for a full NTP (Notice To Proceed) to begin
 construction on May 1, and we are working hard to be ready for that key
 milestone to occur. Your review and concurrence on the draft document
 attached below is appreciated.
 
 Please review and contact me should you have any questions.
 
 Sincerely
