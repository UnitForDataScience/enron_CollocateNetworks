 Let's talk about it. It seems like an open personality clash developing 
 for the first time in the history of the group.

 This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating 
 his Asian option portfolio. 
 He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see 
 the difference made to the model.
 
 As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new 
 input parameter 'Sig' is.
 
 Thanks,
