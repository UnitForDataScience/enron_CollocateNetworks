 Chrisone labelled '9AM' and one labelled 'Intraday' which is an update of
 the requirements reported in the 9AM column.   The two columns will be
 identical in instances where no change has been made.   Where the two numbers
 differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement.  In some cases where
 there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) , you will see negative values for the
 'PRIMARY' requirement.  This represents a situation where gas is being
 withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month
 baseload daily 'PRIMARY' volume.
 
 Please call if you have questions, etc.
