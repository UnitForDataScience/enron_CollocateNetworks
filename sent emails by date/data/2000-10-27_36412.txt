 George, we need a new trade zone added for a new pipe (Wildhorse Energy 
 Partners, LLC)
 
 Pipe Code:   WHEP
 Trade Zone: WHEP
 
 The scheduler is Jaqueline Adams at X33918.  She agrees that the trade zone 
 can be the same as the pipe code.
 
 Please let me know as soon as this zone is added, so that I may get started 
 on added all the meters.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Faye
