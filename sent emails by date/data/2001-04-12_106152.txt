 Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
 3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
 have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side
 letter agreement."  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
 finalize by April 6.  Thanks.
