 I need to know what counterparties invoiced ENA for Penalties ,or netted them 
 in a payment we received for December production. I will need the amount of 
 the Penalty , the Counterparty , and the deal that the penalty is related to .
 
 
 Unfortunately I need this information before you leave today.
 
 
 Let me know if you any questions
