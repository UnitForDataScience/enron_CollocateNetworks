 Rolo-
 
 We can agree to sign the Master ISDA without the CSA.  However, we will be 
 maintaining the BBB- MAC trigger, 3rd Party Event of Default at $15MM, and 
 the Change in Ownership provision.  I do not want to agree to any of their 
 changes other than removing the CSA.   
 
 Please call me in the morning concerning the 2,500 ton/month LPG transaction 
 regarding how we will want to confirm this deal.
 
 Regards,
 
 Pat
