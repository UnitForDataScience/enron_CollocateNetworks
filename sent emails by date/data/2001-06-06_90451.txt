 Hi Fletch,
 
 
 	Thanks for returning my call and for taking the time to look over this
 cover letter with attached resume.  I should be heading out to the driving
 range one of these weeknights. Drop me line if you're interested?
 
 I'm looking for a position on the Enron energy trading floor. The personal
 and professional qualities that make me a successful mutual fund wholesaler
 will make me a strong contributor to your trading team.
 	As my resume reflects, I have plenty of analytical skills combined with
 hands-on  fixed income and equity trading. I have consistently grown
 business because I pay attention to details and thrive in a fast-paced
 environment. My experience and success in developing business has come about
 through learning quickly, planning ahead, and working well within a team
 environment.
 I would enjoy answering your questions, and discussing how my skills and
 experience could contribute to your team. Thank you for your interest in my
 application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 
 Dac Calderhead
