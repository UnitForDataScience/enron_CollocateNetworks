 Kevin:
 
 I work in Portland in West Power tradng and have day-to-day responsibility 
 for managing the Can Fibre account.  Since this deal started in Sept. they 
 have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are 
 currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on 
 another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two "heart-to-heart" 
 discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm 
 building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this 
 start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem 
 disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.  
 If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and 
 legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should 
 take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake 
 Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me 
 a call at 503/464-3822 and give me uyour thoughts? 
 
 Thanks!
 
 Chris
