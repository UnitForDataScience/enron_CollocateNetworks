 She currently has a 65.  I need her timeline paper and her "7th grade"
 questions.  Thanks!
 

 
 
 Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -
 
 Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today.  What is her
 grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that
 she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.
