 It makes sense to meet with Abacus. Retail marketing is very data intensive. 
 If you set up a meeting with them,
 please, let me know.

 Tim,
 
 I hope things are going well in Resco.  I think somebody from Resco (or 
 Research) may be interested in the email I received below from Brad Davids.  
 Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as 
 well as predictive modelling.  He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this 
 month.  I'm not sure who is responsible for Resco Marketing, but I think they 
 would find this interesting.  Who should I send this to?   Please let me know 
 if anybody in Resco may have any interest.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Steve
 
 PS:  Vince, simply an FYI since they do focus on modelling and research.
