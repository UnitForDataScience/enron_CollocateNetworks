
 
 Billy,
 
 We can give Bobby a call and carry out a preliminary interview over the phone.
 I am always a bit suspicious when I see somebody trying
 to leave a very good company after a relatively short time.

 Billy:
 
 I hope all is well.  Per our discussion today, provided as an attachment are
 my cover letter and resume.
 
 Kind Regards,
 Bobby Demissie
