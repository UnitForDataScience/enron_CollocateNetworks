 brenda was a test.  stratego failed.  this email is yet more evidence.  
 
 the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me in the least.  
 
 the fact that you are still representing makes me sad.  
 
 asking for props?  please, dude, the depths of your selfishness have yet to be established.  
 
 don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches.  take a moment and peer inside - that tinge of guilt?  that's what i'm talking about.
 
 in any case, i don't plan on claiming anyone again.   
 
 
  

       
        
 
       Hey Jai,
       Now that I look back at these pictures I kind of look like a loser.
       But, oh
 
       well.  I'm going to the game on Sat.  I won tickets through Molson
       Canadian!!  I'm pretty pumped!  It's the game against Anaheim.  Isn't
       that
       the one that you were talking about?
       Well, have a great day!
       Brenda
