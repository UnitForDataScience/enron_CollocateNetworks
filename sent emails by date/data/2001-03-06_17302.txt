 Sarah,
 
 The FTC info that you need is set forth below.  Please let me know when you 
 have had a chance to review it and we can go from there.  Perhaps you and 
 Jeff Dasovich and I could set up a call to discuss this?  If that sounds 
 good, let me know when would be a good time to chat and I'll set it up.  
 Thanks very much.
 
 Lara
