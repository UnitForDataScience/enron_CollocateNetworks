  Tom May, our new NY trader, wants to wheel power 
 to/from NEPOOL or NY through Hydro Quebec Power and New Brunswick Power.  
 Rhonda and I will take care of the EPMI wheeling agreements on HQ and New 
 Brunswick.  Who can make sure that EPMI has the necessary export permits to 
 take power out of Canada (DOE or NEB)?  Thanks.
