 How are you feeling today?  I couldn't get to sleep until 11 pm, but I=20
 actually feel pretty good.  I'm excited because Steve H. replied and said I=
 =20
 could definitely come down, although, he said are contract is over at the e=
 nd=20
 of jan and his tour might be over!  still waiting to hear whether a=20
 non-renewal is a realistic possibility or whether its like every other year=
 . =20
 I thought you mentioned that we got all that 8 mil or whatever of work down=
 =20
 there.  Interesting.... anyway, I finally got signed up for the continental=
 =20
 travel specials.  I assume you get them but just incase you wanted to go to=
 =20
 Louisville, KY or something, I thought I'd send it along.  I'd take=20
 advantage, but I'm have to work a few hours this weekend and I think its a=
 =20
 little late to switch with somebody. =20
 
 Well, I should get back to work although it looks like now is just a sit=20
 around and bullshit about California gas period in the day.
 
 Later....=20
