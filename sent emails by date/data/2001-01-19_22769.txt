 for some time, Dave Duran and his group have distinct goals to move this 
 strategy forward in 2001.

 Doug -Mike Beyer worked on this idea last summer.  The problem we had was our 
 need to focus on shorter term opportunities - and the bodies that would be 
 required to do a good job.  I know that ENA is / was looking at some 
 brownfield opportunities - but I haven't heard of any developments.
 
 Thanks,

 George,
 
 I'm sure I am way over simplifying this, but in light of current natural gas 
 prices and the past success ENA had building six natural gas power plants 
 wouldn't the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the 
 US? I'm sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting 
 process is far more severe than the natural gas process, but it would seem 
 Enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants. Wouldn't it 
 make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual 
 coal supply, whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and 
 then supply power by wire to surrounding states. States rich in coal reserves 
 are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and 
 therefore may speed the permitting process along. Building the power 
 transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive, but 
 has this approach been analyzed by the coal group? 
 
 Regards,
 Doug
