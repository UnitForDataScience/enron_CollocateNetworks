 The e-mail was sent on 1/3/2002, but the detail states that "TXU Energy Trading Company should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in the agreement between TXU and EPMI".  The e-mail does not give any details on ENA, ECC, of EES.

 Carl,
 
 Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
 exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
 then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.
 
 I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
 applies to Garden State Paper.
 
 As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
 and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
 structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
 intent as required.
 
 THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
 FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
 NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE
 
 Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.
 
 thanks
 
 JDS
