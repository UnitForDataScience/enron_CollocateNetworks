 then please.  Sara
 
 








  
 Here is the update:
 
 1. BONY is getting a legal opinion on the ADR issuance and is in contact with 
 Millenium's attorneys.
 
 2. DKB has performed investigations on whether these ADRs must be restricted, 
 DKB's view is that they should not restricted.  This is highly arcane US SEC 
 law (so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points), but my 
 understanding is that DKB views the sale of the local shares as a real sale, 
 with a public notice, a public underwritten auction etc,and there is nothing 
 restricted about the shares.  I don't think BONY would dispute that, but I 
 think their interpretation (and our legal view) is that the shares are 
 restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the SEC 
 under the original ADR issuance and, critically, they were sold by the 
 "Issuer".   That is, BONY's view is that BNDES is the same as Millenium b/c 
 they are both government entities
