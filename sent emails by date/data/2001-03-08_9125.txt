 interesting, and definitely can relate to some of the things that we 
 discussed in Dallas.  Please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the 
 subject.  I will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying 
 to "size" the market for our services and get that out to all attendees 
 within the next week or so.  organised counterparties which 
 would decrease the number of fails)
 This last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of 
 demand for EEO services from outside would be to have the standard cycle 
 times reduced (have FERC insist?). But we would have to make sure we could 
 cope to!
