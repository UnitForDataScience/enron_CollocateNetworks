
 
 Is there a time limit for lodging an objection?
 
 
 
 


  
  
 the first step would be to object to the party making the request.  If the
 parties cannot work it out as between themselves, the one with the objection
 can appeal to the Commission.  I don't believe it would weaken our position
 to have released the information to the Public Staff for some of the same
 reasons I suggested earlier

 



  
 
 Hi Allyson,
 
 What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has
 intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office
 (or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the
 confidential information we file?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
