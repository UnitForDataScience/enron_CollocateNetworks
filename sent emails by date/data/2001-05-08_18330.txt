 Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California 
 Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California 
 Chamber of Commerce.
 
 Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally 
 supportivehe, too, is very supportive.
 
 We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support 
 and pitch:
 
 1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve 
 this now, and 
 2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've 
 described.   
 
 They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before 
 they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly 
 didn't reject the idea.
 
 Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
