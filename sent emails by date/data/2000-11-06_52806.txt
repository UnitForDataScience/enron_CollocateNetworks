 I want to invite Louise Kitchen to this conference.
 She is the President of EnronOnLine.
 Greg Whalley will be in London this day.

 Vince,
 
 >Given the energy-finance focus of the Conference, do you believe the

 Per my above concern, I'd like to discuss the matter with you further.
 Thanks,
 Ehud
