 What a mess this is.  I need your advice on what I should do.  I was told 
 that the only way that I can play on the Rice team is to either play with a 
 3.5 man or not to play on my Tuesday night league.  Bill tells me that there 
 are no 3.5 men available to add to our roster.  Is that true?  This is really 
 a difficult choice for me because I really enjoy playing on the Tuesday night 
 team and i still feel that we have a chance to advance further.  What do you 
 think I should do?
