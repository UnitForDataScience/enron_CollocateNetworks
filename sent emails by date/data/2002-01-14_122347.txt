
 
 Let's meet after the staff meeting today to discuss carving out existing capacity for June 1 as well as what, if anything, we say to the shippers for now.  Lorraine, would you please bring the volume needed for Red Rock contracts for June and July.  If we carve out existing capacity, we still may not have enough for al of them without prorating.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
