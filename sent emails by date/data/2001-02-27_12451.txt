 the correspondance relating to the request of replacing the existing mixing 
 valves with carburetors at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.  In 
 this discussion, Jon Fields of Argent Consulting was involved.  I have 
 attached for your review the letter requests from Northern to you and the 
 e-mails which were traded back and forth from yourself and Argent.  The 
 results of the pre testing emissions with the mixing valves on and the post 
 testing of the emissions with the carburetors on were mailed to you on Jan. 
 20, 2001.  The testing results were compiled in hard copy form and are not 
 included with this submittal, but can be resubmitted if requested.  Your 
 favorable request in this replacement activity is requested.

 IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
 and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
 that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
 change.

 What say you all?
