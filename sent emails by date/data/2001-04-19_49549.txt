 attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.
 
 We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least 
 one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage around 
 his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside a 
 large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a small 
 portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology, 
 which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.
 
 In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification, 
 or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in the 
 attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify "residual 
 time value" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of a 
 more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?
 
 Thanks,

 Jeff,
 
 A few comments on the model:
 
 1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
 to
 discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
 our insights to the consultant.
 In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
 details and in the inputs and
 calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
 depending
 on the quality of inputs. 
 
 2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
 were told that you
 would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.
