 Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required 
 
 Clause 10 B (1) to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS1 form. Please 
 note that the TS1 form requires a CA certificate
 If we sell on an exchange through a broker, clause 10 B (2) (a) (i) will 
 apply. Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held 
 by the company, there is time from when the sale order is given to the 
 broker. 
 Clause 11 (2) provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the 
 money to Mauritius. Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause 
 11 (2) (c). Also, it seems from Clause 11 (2) (b) that if we sell through the 
 exchange, then approval of RBI under the TS1 is not required for the 
 repatriation.
