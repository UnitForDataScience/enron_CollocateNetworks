 1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
 finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
 market-based rate authority.
 
 2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
 more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
 SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.
 
 The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
 and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
 asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
 August.
 
 This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
 Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
 Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
 discuss this with you.
 
 Call with questions.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
