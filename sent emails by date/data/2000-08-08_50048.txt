 Enron currently has 8 interview rooms scheduled on December 11, 2000... As
 we have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 11/3 we currently have
 nine rooms booked, if Enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 11/3, we
 probably will not be able to host them on-campus unless [the firm currently
 holding the rooms] moves off (and there is a possibility of that - this is
 like a game of dominos).  However, Enron could interview off campus, but
 that is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for the
 employer.  If Enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 11/3 for just
 Comp Finance, we would find a way to accomodate them.  Our Recruiting
 Coordinator, Sally Gould, will do everything she can to make this work for
 Enron.  Please suggest that Enron re-contact her as soon as they know what
 their preferences are.  Alison knows how to reach her.
