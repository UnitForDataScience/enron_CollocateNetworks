 I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  
 
 I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times 

    
 
 Q,
 
 I'm sorry about this morning.  I really was trying to be nice by making some
 coffee and turning up the heat so it would be easier for you to get out of
 bed.  How was your physical?  Did they give you an antibiotic?  Let me know.
 
 Love Kim
