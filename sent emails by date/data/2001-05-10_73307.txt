 Before we send anything other than the "thank you" e-mail I sent to Jeff, and 
 before we have any conversations with GE on this point, we need to seek Kay's 
 guidance based on her read of the contract and the issues Jeff raised in his 
 letter.
 
 Kay - will you have some time to talk about this Friday?
 
 Regards,

 The way we actually paid the invoices changed slightly after Chris had sent 
 the letter to GE.  We deducted the LD's and the retention amount from the 
 April 25th invoice (since the May invoice was not due until May 25th).
 
 On May 8th, a wire totalling $1,671,039 was sent to GE 
 
 




 
  
 
 Chris,
 
 Please see attached letter, original to follow via FedEx.
