 What lawyer handles daily financial trading issues?  I need to speak with 
 that person about US swap eligibility rules governing US companies, 
 specifically, ECTRIC, and who evaluates ECTRIC's counterparties for 
 eligibility.  The specific issue has to do with Total as you will see from 
 the string of emails attached.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

 We have passed them for SFA requirements in London so yes they can trade 
 through London no problem at all.  (see Regulatory tab in CAS)
 Any problems, let me know.

 Paul,
 
 I have a trader that is trying to trade financially with Total International 
 Ltd., but we have asked that he not until we can sort our some eligibility 
 issues.  Prior to speaking with Ben Hamida at Total last week, we had never 
 approached them for financial statements or a guaranty that would establish 
 them as elibible contract parties.  I noticed that we have significant 
 financial trading with them in London.  How have you established eligibilty?  
 My trader is asking, since he cannot trade under ENA with Total, if he can 
 sleave deals through London.
 
 Any ideas or insight would be helpful.
 
 thanks
 brant
