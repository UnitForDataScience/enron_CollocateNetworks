 Hello - I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language 
 from Peoples regarding Audit Rights.  His initial reaction was that their 
 request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly 
 owned L.L.C.  However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect 
 Enron's interests.
 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to 
 enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate 
 confidentiality agreement.  This language has been included in the attached 
 draft.  My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end 
 of today.  Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting 
 further blurred each passing day.  Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there 
 are any problems with the draft as written.  Otherwise, I will be sending it 
 to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning.  Thanks for your prompt 
 attention to this.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gregg
