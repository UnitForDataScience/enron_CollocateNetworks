 Sorry for the delay.  I see no problems with this in the current format.  
 There might be an issue if the description of the product included the word 
 COMEX or any other trademark of the exchange.  I'm not too concerned about 
 the presence of "COMEX" in the long description since presumably that will 
 not appear on Reuters.

 Mark and Mark - still haven't heard anything on this .   Could one of you get 
 back to me today if possible?   Need to know  "Go / No Go" re: Comex products 
 as soon as possible.  
 
 Many thanks,
 Paul

 I would very much like to have these product prices published on Reuters, 
 please call me on x32093 to discuss.
 
 There are other physical products which I will show you if you would like to 
 come to my desk.

 Hi David - wanted to check with you to see if you would be okay with us 
 feeding live bids/offers to Reuters for the COMEX products shown below.   
 Originally, when I met with Joe Gold some weeks ago, we had intended to feed 
 many of our LME prices to Reuters, but due to the LME member rules 
 restricting us, we were precluded from doing so.  
 
 As such, we are hoping that we could at least feed the live quotes we have in 
 place for the 2 physical COMEX products (and , if possible , the financial 
 COMEX lookalike).  As part of our deal with Reuters, both we and Reuters are 
 very keen to feed some quotes for metals products. Also, if there are any 
 other non-LME restricted physical products you know of, we may be interested 
 in feeding these as well.
 
 Could we have a quick chat about this before the end of today ?  
 
 Many thanks,
 Paul
