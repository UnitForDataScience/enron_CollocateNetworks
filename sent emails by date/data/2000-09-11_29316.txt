 cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a
 lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per
 room+ $25/head/night.
 
 So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have
 been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked
 in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little
 clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due
 around this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4,
 right?  Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone
 else that's interested other than the folks that have already been invited,
 let me know as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have
 around 10.  Talk to you.  DF
