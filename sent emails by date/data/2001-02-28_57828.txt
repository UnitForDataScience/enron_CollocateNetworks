 Despite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue 
 receivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX 
 47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for 
 Friday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will 
 go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.
 
 Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and 
 the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific 
 legislators.  A significant PR push is planned.
 
 SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One 
 angle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and 
 make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support.
