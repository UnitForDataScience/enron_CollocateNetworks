 Power World will be in next week to conduct training.
 
 We plan to begin at 11:00 AM on Wednesday (6/27) and end about 6:00 PM, to accommodate the trading floor's schedule.  
 
 On Thursday (6/28), we will begin at 11:00 AM and end about 4:00 PM.  
 
 All participants will need to have a laptop and an external mouse. I will get back to everyone on the room number later.
