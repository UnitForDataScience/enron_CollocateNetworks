 Attached is the Opposition of the City and County of San Francisco to the
 trading motion.  They make several evidentiary objections.  To be on the
 safe side, we suggest filing supplemental declarations from each of you on
 the issues raised in the Opposition.  I will subsequently e-mail suggested
 text to you.  Since the hearing is on Friday morning, we will need to file
 these declarations by Thursday early afternoon at the latest.  Accordingly,
 once you receive them, please finalize the declarations and fax them back to
 me at (213) 892-4707 as soon as possible, but by no later than Noon
 tomorrow.
 
 Thank you.
