 /Non-Solicitation agreement  employees' 
 Personnel History (PH) file?
 The document is an agreement only between an "employee" and Enron.  What 
 about all of the contractors working in HR?  Will they be required to sign a 
 similar agreement or should this be covered in the master agreement with the 
 vendor and/or individual consultant?
 
 Thanks for your response.
