 if you want i can just pick you up at the airport and take you to dinner
 from there, i have to go right by the airport on my way to santa monica.  i
 think my teeth are still purple from all the wine i drank this
 weekend.........
 
 

 
  
 
 
 What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I
 think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he
 is out of luck and on his own!
