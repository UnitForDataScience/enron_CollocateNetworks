 Isn't it crazy.  Someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $900.  Unbelievable.  I am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in.  We have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $4.

       I saw that in USA Today as I was getting on a plane this moring.
 
       I tried to send you an email to enron.com day before yesterday
 and
    it
       was returned saying it didn't exist.  Curious.

       Looks like due to the Enron debacle, you guys can make some
    money...On
       Ebay the cups I sent you are going for $50 and higher.  Make
 your
    money
       while you can.
