 We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.
 
 Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?
 
 Thanks
 Mike
