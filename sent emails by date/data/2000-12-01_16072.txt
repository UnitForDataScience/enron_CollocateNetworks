
 
 Today Mona and I attended a meeting of the "California Energy Solutions 
 Group" (formerly the AB 1890 Implementation Group).  But for the issues 
 discussed below, there's not much else to report from the meeting other than 
 folks engaged in a good deal of posturing.
 
 At our urging, the group decided to form a "subcommittee" comprised of a 
 subset of the group.  The group will work quickly to develop a "strawperson" 
 proposal to present to the larger group for consideration.  The goal is to 
 quickly arrive at a "settlement"similar to 
 the model used for utility procurement on the gas side.  Chris Calger is in 
 the office working on the power plant deals and I briefly discussed with him 
 ways of devising a politically palatable, commercially defensible benchmark.  
 We came up with some ideas that he suggested I pursue further with Bob 
 Badeer, Chris Foster and Tim Belden, which I'll do on Monday.   The first 
 meeting of the subcommittee is on Tuesday.
 
 If possible, I'd like to add the "benchmark" and "committee" issues to our 
 agenda for Tuesday's meeting.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
