 I would recommend that when we intervene in RP01-484, the Joint Complaint against El Paso, that we side with the complainants against continuation of the FR contracts.  The gist of the complaint is that the full requirements contracts (East of California customers) on El Paso are creating capacity problems, as the loads these contracts serve keep growing, and cutting into El Paso's ability to serve the California customers.  My real problem is EES's inability to get firm primary rights into Arizona markets, which cost us millions in imbalance charges earlier this year.  Any thoughts?  Becky, has it been noticed yet?
