 Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go 
 through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the 
 future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to 
 the process.
 
 Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?
 
 Thank you,
 
 Kay
 
 
 







 
  
 Kay:
 
 This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
 acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
 used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
 sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
 Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
 We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
 October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
 (312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.
