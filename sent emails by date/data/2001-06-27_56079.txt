
 
 Shirley,
 
 No problem.
 
 
 Vince
   have been invited to dinner at
 the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.
 
 Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
 remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
 attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
 schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
 for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
 7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.
 
 Hope all is well.  Best,
 Ehud
