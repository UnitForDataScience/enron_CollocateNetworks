 Dear Rob:
 
    I am going to be in Houston on business next week from Wednesday on.  I
 wondered if there might be a convenient time to stop in to say hello and if
 possible take you up on your offer of an introduction to Jim Derrick.  I
 have a series of meetings downtown over the three days.  Any one could
 easily be moved.  
 
    Thanks for your help.
 
    Kindest regards.
 
 
                   Chris Allegaert
