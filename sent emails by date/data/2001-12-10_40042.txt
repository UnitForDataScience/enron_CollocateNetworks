 John Sherriff has advised us of the proposal for you to lead a team to close out and maximise the value of the ECTRIC assets. Michelle Cash is the employment lawyer who is best placed to provide you with the agreements you require to obtain and keep the team you require.
 	
 Please could you send the list of individuals you need on the team to David Oxley and Michelle Cash who will advise further.
 	
 Kind regards,
