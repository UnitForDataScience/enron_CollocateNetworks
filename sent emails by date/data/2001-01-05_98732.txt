 garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six 
 months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year 
 old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously 
 considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother 
 and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his 
 divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is 
 current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to 
 move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his 
 daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of 
 brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in 
 law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the 
 mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An 
 attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, 
 I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on 
 his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help.
