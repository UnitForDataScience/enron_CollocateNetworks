 run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest.  In 
 this case, I would get in touch with Andy Fastow, Ben Glissan or someone in 
 the finance group in London.  That way, we can make a better determination 
 about the value of the relationship, make sure those who are interested in 
 pitching them on doing bus. with Enron can be involved. Or, we can make a 
 determination to decline.  I think we decide who we want to let in then do it 
 for free, rather than charging.

 I'm not in favor of charging a fee; that takes the goodwill out of it.   I'm 
 open to discussion on how often we host these meetings, however.

 I believe that Cindy and I can keep doing these and there is certainly a 
 "goodwill" element here...and maybe that is the way to handle it. OR we might 
 want to think about "formalizing" this, say once a quarter and sending out 
 "invitations" and, maybe, charging for this????I think there are pros and 
 cons on all sides of the charging issue.....maybe we should get together and 
 discuss? Beth

 Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 I am trying to find a contact within your organisation who could help me set 
 up
 a meeting between a member of your Company and members of an Irish Bank who 
 are
 extremely interested in sending a senior level delegation on a study visit to
 recognised leaders in certain fields, in particular the Innovativeness and
 Getting / Keeping Talent areas of the fortune survey.
 
 We recognise that you have won awards in these areas of the fortune survey and
 would like to contact someone in this field.
 
 I look forward to receiving your reply.
 
 Many thanks
 Elizabeth
