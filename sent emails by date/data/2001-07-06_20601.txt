 WASHINGTON enc=
 ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment=
 ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it=
 s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend=
 ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als=
 o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp=
 ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the=
  president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee=
 ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials=
  say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ=
 y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas=
 kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f=
 or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr=
 oval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t=
 he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin=
 g blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and =
 last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call=
  for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue =
 and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui=
 ck solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a polit=
 ical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Lik=
 e the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, e=
 nergy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.  =09
