 Howard:
 
 I don't believe the Committee has agreed to recommend that McCutcheon Doyle
 be compensated for its "commandeering" litigation support.  I'm not saying
 the Committee wouldn't, but we have not taken formal action.
 
 Moreover, the Committee has yet to determine who should prosecute the
 "commandeering" claims once the Committee acquires control over them.  Prior
 to Greenberg, Glusker's engagement, the Committee determined to reserve for
 a later date whether special counsel should be retained.  I believe the
 Committee would like to hear from Greenberg, Glusker again a description of
 the firm's qualifications in this regard as well as interview other firms
 which may be qualified to take on the task.
