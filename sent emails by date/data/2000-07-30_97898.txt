 Richard could you please review Section 4 (f) of the attached NDA from 
 Microsoft regarding exclusive jurisdiction.  I proposed non-exclusive New 
 York jurisdiction and this is their response.  If you could call me or e-mail 
 me your comments, I would greatly appreciate it.  Michelle Hicks referred me 
 to you.
