
 
 Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:
 
 	1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
 	2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
 	3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
 	4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.  Do you agree, Robert?
 
 To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's 40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.  
 
 Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America Corp.
