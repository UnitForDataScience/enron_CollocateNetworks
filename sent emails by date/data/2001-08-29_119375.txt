 I hope you are enjoying your new job!  Sounds like a great opportunity.    I need to ask you for a favor.  We are working with the Wyoming Govenor and the Wyoming Business Council to develop positive relations between Enron and the State of Wyoming.  Paul Kauffman is trying to get the Govenor to support his ideas regarding the RTO in the West and we are working with them to manage some of their price risk on their royalties as well as support our development efforts in the state.
 
 One thing that would help us in our relations is to help the Govenor's staff understand Enron's market making capabilities.  In order to do this I would like to get a member of his staff access to EOL.  He would need read only access, but I would not want him to be turned off after 2 weeks.  If you can help me with this I would really appreciate it.
 

 
 If someone can call me I will help orchestrate his registration.
 
 My number is 303-575-6473.
 
 Thanks
