 backup!  Michelle
 
 
 
 
 



   
 
 Thanks, that helps a lot. Looking forward to seeing you guys, too.
 
 
  Sony would be best.  Also, he always wears short-sleeved
 Polo shirts, size XL.  He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he
 never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.
 
 Let me know if you need any other suggestions.
 
 We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.  He always is
 talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
 Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

 Michelle,
      Can you give me any ideas regarding birthday and x-mas presents for
 the man

 Hope all is well there.
