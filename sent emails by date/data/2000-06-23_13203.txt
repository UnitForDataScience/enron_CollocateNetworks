 Spoke with Leaf - no questions or concerns.  Please prepare executable.

 Any word from Leaf?  Are we needing an executable?

 Tim is fine with the draft agreement.  I am sending overnight to Leaf today, 
 so I will come back to you with any of his comments tomorrow.
 
 Thanks for your help in this matter.
