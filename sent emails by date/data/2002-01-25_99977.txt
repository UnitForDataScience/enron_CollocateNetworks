 The following points need updating in PLE
 
 1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
 56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
 500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS
