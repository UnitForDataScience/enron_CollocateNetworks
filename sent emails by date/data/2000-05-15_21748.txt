 =20
 The sponsorship of this idea clearly fits in Net Works.  Could one of you=
 =20
 fine gentlemen give his idea a test drive?  I would much appreciate if you=
 =20
 could give him a call.

 Today is always here; yesterday is gone; and tomorrow never comes.  Time=20
 offers opportunity but demands a sense of urgency.  Now is the time.  This =
 is=20
 the place.  You are the one!
 
 Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now=
 -=20
 the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.
 
 ? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
 ? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
 ? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
 ? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
 ? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
 ? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
 ? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant=20
 circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

 I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These=
 =20
 commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would=
 =20
 like the opportunity to create this group.
