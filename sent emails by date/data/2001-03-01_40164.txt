 prices over the price cap pursuant to Section 4.5.1of its Market Monitoring 
 Protocol.  This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit very broad 
 authority to request information, specifically: "the submission of any 
 infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be 
 potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose 
 activies may affect the operation of the ISO market."  
 
 Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.  The FERC did not order 
 us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now requesting it.  
 I think our only available approach is to provide the information to the ISO 
 pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.  I have asked Sue Mara if she would 
 contact WPTF about negotiating a confidentiality agreement.  Richard, please 
 advise if this is the proper course of action.  Please note, the information 
 is due tomorrow.

 I agree with Dan.  Have we sold above the cap?  If so, report.  If not, tell 
 them we will let them know when we do.
