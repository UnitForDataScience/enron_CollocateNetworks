 I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts. I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas. Any questions give me a shout.

 Attached is the information that we discussed last evening. 
 
 Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index. 
         The tabs that indicate "OXY II Only" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
 
         The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity. 
 
 If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.
