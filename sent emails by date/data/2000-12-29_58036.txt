 Linda and I made a courtesy visit to Jim Derrick last Friday.  Jim suggested 
 that we contact Michelle Cash about participating in the law conference on 
 the program.  I called Michelle to inquire about the program and she told me 
 that you and she had already spoken.  Linda is not seeking a place on the 
 program, but will be pleased to participate if our decides to make a 
 presentation.  Let us know how you want us to handle.
 
 Thanks - Chris
