 and I had last week, you're going to set up a meeting with Tim to discuss 
 this.  Something we need to get our arms around fairly quickly.  Any 
 possibility of doing it on Monday?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said 

 
 









    
 For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
 issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
 comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
 already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
 to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
 cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
 haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.
