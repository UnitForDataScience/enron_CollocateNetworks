 In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the
 terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't
 assign "primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.
 The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the
 issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if
 what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise
 available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles,
 then let me offer the following.
 
 Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could
 physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles
 receipt point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to
 its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to
 exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09
 Bcf/d.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 


 
  
 
 
 

 
  
      Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
 point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
 rights. or some other number?
