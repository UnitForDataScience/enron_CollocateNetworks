  such as a $12=
 4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu=
 ary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER=
 C members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to =
 act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda=
 y, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at the sett=
 lement, declared he was "gratified" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they v=
 alidated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rej=
 ected at the talks' outset. "We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of=
  refunds and we'll get back lots of money," he said, adding that what the s=
 tate doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power genera=
 tors, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as "ludicrous" and =
 "unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The state came away=
  with far less than its expectations," said Robert Loeffler, an attorney fo=
 r a unit of AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. "The common expectation now is that=
  any refunds will be way below this $9 billion."=09
