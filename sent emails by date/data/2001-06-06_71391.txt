 timing restriction.  You lose one layer of optionality.
 
 
 


  
  
 So if we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext the entire project 
 goes on the balance sheet since we will be committed to building a road and 
 stormwater system.  There we all must be aware that we can not close on the 
 property until the LLC is owned by ENext.  Do you agree?

 Greg has Christi's comments on the FPL Construction & Connection Agreement, 
 and he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we 
 engaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I'd like to have a 
 commercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance 
 to comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on 
 given his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?
 
 Please let me know. Thanks.
 
 Attached is the original generic form of FPL Connection and Construction 
 Agreement for your reference.
