 Drew -
 
 Bob Chandler said you were looking into the ownership structure questions.
 If ENBT Delaware and Potomac Capital are truly third parties and not Enron
 entities, I just want to make sure Enron does not control these entities,
 because if Enron does, then we should probably say "wholly" owned in our
 opinion rather than "majority" owned.
 
 Thanks for your assistance!
 
 Heather
