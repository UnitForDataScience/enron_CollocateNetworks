 Hi Vince, Mark Holsworth reviewed our contract on such a short notice.  I 
 thank Mark for responding to our short-notice request.  It turns out that we 
 need to get this database to move forward on a number of things and have 
 legal save some time for us is an excellent help.  As mentioned below, It 
 appears that PennWell's folks want to chat some more about this. 
 
 Mark, can you schedule a conference call with these people to finalise this 
 contract.  I will be out of town all week next week on a lock-down deal 
 meeting. Vince may be able to get on the conference call.  I would greatly 
 appreciate it if you could help us close this one!
 
 Regards,
 
 Ravi.
