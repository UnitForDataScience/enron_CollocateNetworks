 Mark,
        Our attorney said that modifying the attached Agreement so that the
 protected party is " CEMEX USA Management, Inc., as well as its affiliates
 (CEMEX), " is acceptable.  Please make the required changes and send the
 document to my secretary, Cindy Evangelista.   I am on vacation until 
 1/4/2000,
 but will try to progress the signing of the Agreement while I'm gone.  
 Regards,
 GPB
