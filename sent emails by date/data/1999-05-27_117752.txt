 Carol, I apologize for the delay in getting this to you.  Attached is a form 
 that V&E just put together for us.  I think the format will be good for your 
 purposes.  Let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Regarding World Color Press, I will give you a call.  I spoke to Michelle 
 Maynard, the lawyer on the transaction.  I need to check on a couple of other 
 things before we talk.
 
 Thanks, Kim
