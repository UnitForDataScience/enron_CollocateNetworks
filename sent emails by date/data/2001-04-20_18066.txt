 Would you mind putting it down on paper so I can give it to Lay?  Just two or 
 so bullets of the El Paso accusation and then some bullets on the more 
 fundamental story.

 You got it.  Just give me a call and we'll walk through "the other side of

 Can I talk you or someone else who is close to this into a one pager on why  
 a simple supply/demand explanation of California border prices trumps 
 Carpenter's El Paso dun it conspiracy analysis?
 
 I don't want Lay to be stumped by a question on this at his Wednesday IAEE 
 talk.
