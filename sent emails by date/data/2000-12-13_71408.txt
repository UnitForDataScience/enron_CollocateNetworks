 Kay -
 
 Sending this from Don's e-mail.
 
 My apologies, but I just realized that #5 should have the following inserted 
 after the word Gleason in both the first and third lines:
 
 " , Brownsville, "
 
 This is to make #5 consistent with #7.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mitch

 Gentlemen,
 
 I've revised paragraph 5 to reflect our discussion.  Also, I made a change
 to paragraph 7 to include technical bulletins per Mitch's request which we
 did not discuss on our call.

 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
