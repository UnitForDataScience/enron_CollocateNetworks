
 
 Julia,
 
 I am sending you a copy of the nondisclosure agreement I received from a  
 professor at UT
 Austin. Three UT academics developed a model that may be useful in our pricing
 applications. They envisage the possibility of either selling this model to 
 Enron or of joint research 
 effort in this area.
 
 Can you, please, take a look at the attached legal document.
 
 Vince
