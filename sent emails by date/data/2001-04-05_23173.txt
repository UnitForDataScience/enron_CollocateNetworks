 Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS l=
 itigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties app=
 roximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final fi=
 gure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the pr=
 incipal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take =
 as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the pa=
 rt of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  T=
 he opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended=
 " rather than applying the provisions of the contract. =20
 
 For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear th=
 at the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after p=
 ayments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacce=
 ptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Bloc=
 k gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore n=
 ot entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Co=
 mmencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a decl=
 aration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.
 
 As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines th=
 at the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  T=
 he contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that=
  it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Tr=
 ansportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduc=
 tion for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statemen=
 t is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that=
  upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an a=
 bsolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.
 
 Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected ou=
 r submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the=
  restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue u=
 pon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the =
 point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs sho=
 uld have been a given.=20
 
 Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, ou=
 r other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," an=
 d describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  Unfort=
 unately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (excep=
 t of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse=
 .
 
 In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted o=
 r expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support =
 from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coas=
 ter ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence =
 in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it ri=
 ght.=20
 
 Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if=
  you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207=
