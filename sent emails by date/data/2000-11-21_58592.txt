 Steve,
 
 Per our meeting yesterday, attached are the draft letters from Ken Lay to the 
 Board and Advisory Council.  l will deliver a box of Annual Reports today so 
 that they can be delivered to Rebecca Carter once the letters are signed and 
 returned to you. 
 
 Please call me if there are any questions.
