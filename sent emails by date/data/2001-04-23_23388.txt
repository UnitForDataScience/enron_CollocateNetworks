Following my duties in connection with those meetings, I will be departing for San Antonio.  Perhaps Mark and I could talk by telephone this week or visit in San Antonio next week.  Thank you.

 Hi Stephanie,
 
 Mark Evans is in Houston for the conference next week and will be in the Houston office prior to the conference.  He would like to have a meeting with Mr Derrick whilst in the Houston office for, say, 1/2 hour, could you please let me know what time would be most convenient for Mr Derrick on Tuesday,  1 May.
 
 Many thanks
 Tracy
