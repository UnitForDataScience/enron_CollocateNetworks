 allow you to view the Financial Trading Agreement Database, which all the 
 Legal Dept., including the London Legal Dept. should use to track their 
 financial master agreements.  Matt Dawson know how to use this database, if 
 you need to visit with him.

 Further to our telephone conference call this afternoon I thought it would
 be useful to set out the points that were discussed and the outstanding
 issues together with an indication of who is responsible for the next step
 on those points.  Please find attached a document which does this.  I
 understand that the parties would like to have a further conference call
 tomorrow or probably more likely on Friday to revisit these issues and see
 what progress has been made.
 
 Please do not hesitate to contact me with any queries.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Clare Godson
