  I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for 
 the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an 
 officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk 
 heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign.  
 Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this 
 counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone 
 on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the 
 contract be done in ENA's name.

 Debra / Russell - Last week we received a partially executed Enfolio Agmt 
 from Mieco.  Can you please look into the status of the execution on our end 
 so that we can begin tracking in Cr Ag and margin accordingly if need be.
