 Sue, for helping out.  
 
 Best,
 Jeff

  Thanks for your time, Sue.
 
  I hope I am not causing confusion - we also emailed Jeff Dasovich to
 ask if he had time to talk with the Australians - he said he was going to
 see what he could do.
 
  If you or Mr Dasovich might have time to give these guys a market
 participant's view that would be great - at the moment they are only seeing
 the CPUC, the CAISO and PG&E.
 
  Would you maybe have time to talk to them on Tuesday, July 3rd? They
 could meet anytime between 1.00PM up to 4.00PM and then they need to head
 off to the airport. Maybe they could take either of you out for lunch?
 
  Best wishes,
 
  Sabine.
