 Attached is the draft as promised. This reflects input from several members 
 of the team. It is easy to read and flows well. Please review and share you 
 feedback by Wed before noon ( no later, sorry). Once complete, we will 
 circulate the final with your comments. I do need the name of the lawyer that 
 would approve the final draft for the LNG team. 
 
 Hope you had a good trip back.
