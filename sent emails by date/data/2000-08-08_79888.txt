 Per my voicemail.  Please give me a call on this.

 This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk 
 believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over 
 the next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk 
 will buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere 
 from $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are 
 looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or 
 marketing agreements.
 
 The economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as 
 an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect 
 $30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity 
 origination.
 
 Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure 
 around the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether 
 this is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the 
 law.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined 
 in the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this 
 deal.
 
 On the flip side, people have heartburn over "spirit of the law" issues and 
 those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance 
 to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this 
 week whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment 
 so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.
 
 Please let me know your thoughts.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dan
