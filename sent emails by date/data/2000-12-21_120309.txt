 Scott:
 
 Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
 The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:
 
 From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge
 
 from Venice     .05 demand charge
 
 from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
 (if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 
 gathering fee on Mobile Bay)
 
 In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.
 
 The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.
 
 Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
 same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we 
 still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
 on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
 Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
 balancing at any point during the contract term.
 I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
 that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
 gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences 
 for alternate delivery points, please let me know.
 
 As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered 
 price to Ormet.
 
 Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
 due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one 
 hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.
 
 Thank you for all of your help on this deal.
