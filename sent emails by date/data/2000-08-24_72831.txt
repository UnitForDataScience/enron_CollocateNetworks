 Looks like it is worthwhile to finish up what you were working on before.  
 
 Thanks,

      Tammy,
 
      I decided to go ahead and draft the Consignment Agreement in the
      interest of saving time. I'll send you a copy later today, but I
      thought you might want to let Bob know so we don't duplicate efforts.
      The Agreement will generally follow the form of the Mitsubishi
      agreement.
