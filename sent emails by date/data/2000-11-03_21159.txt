 We have closed the following deals where we deliver power two a muni in the 
 short term and get paid back power later on.  These deals have both a 
 commodity and a finance portion:
 
 Counterparty    Loan Period  Repayment Period  Amount Financed
 
 Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
 Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million
 Avista/Kaiser    7/2000   7/2000 to 7/2006   $31.3 million   
 BPA/Kaiser    9/2000   7/2001 to 9/2001   $36 million
 Clatskanie    11/2000 to 9/2001 10/2001 to 9/2006  $5 million
 Eugene Water and Electric  1/2001 to 3/2002  11/2001 to 4/2002  $4.9 million
 Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million
 
 We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is 
 looking at $35,000,000 + in this type of structure.  What do you guys need to 
 know about this business and how much of an appetite do we have for this?
