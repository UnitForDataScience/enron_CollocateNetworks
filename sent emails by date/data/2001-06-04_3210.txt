 Enron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on the
 outlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spoke
 at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.
 
 On Japanese government policy:
      ``The government does have a strong commitment to
 deregulation, but there are some significant policy concerns''
 including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' of
 energy.
      ``The market has been open a bit over a year, however not
 much has happened. No genuine competition exists under the current
 system. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It's
 inevitable.
      ``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the
 U.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400
 percent higher than the U.S.
      ``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of this
 large chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. If
 you compare that business with a company that's just like it in
 Houston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a year
 in the cost of electricity.
      ``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficult
 situation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaise
 in the economy.''
 
 On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in
 Japan:
      ``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI
 (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize it
 was a problem of design, not competition'' in California.
