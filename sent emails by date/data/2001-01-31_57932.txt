 of follow-up items:
 
 Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in 
 identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the 
 extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written 
 this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan  please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic 
 messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California 
 policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively 
 pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the 
 nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we 
 identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.
