 Chris, I called MRI but Frank was too busy to take the call so I left my name 
 and number and said if nothing else I'd see him on the 5th of October.  Just 
 so you'll know, attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed 
 MRI.  Note the prices that were "too high" at the time.    John
