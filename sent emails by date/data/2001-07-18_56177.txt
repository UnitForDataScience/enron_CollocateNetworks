
 
 Billy,
 
 We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.
 
 He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
 a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
 define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
 When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
 complain that the question is too detailed.
 
 
 He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).

 Billy:
 
 I hope all is well.  Per our discussion today, provided as an attachment are
 my cover letter and resume.
 
 Kind Regards,
 Bobby Demissie
