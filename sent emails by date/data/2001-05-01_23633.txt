 Because it covers swaps, a financial lawyer needs to look at it.  Even when 
 the primary exposure is physical.

 Stacy,
 Attached is a draft guaranty from Gulf Resources to cover physical 
 transactions between their sub, Crestar Energy Marketing and ENA.  Can you 
 please review this format and provide your comments.  The guaranty covers 
 purchase/sale and swap transactions, although our primary exposure is only 
 physical natural gas.  I am not sure if one of the financial attorney's needs 
 to look at this too
 
 Thanks
 Russell
