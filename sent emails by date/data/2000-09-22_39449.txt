 I hope this is of help.
 
 I wonder whether you could help on the following point. 
 Paul is coming out to Houston to speak at an Enron conference on 4 October.
 Although we have received a programme for this there is no mention of the
 venue. I believe it is at the Woodlands Resort and Conference Centre and
 wondered whether you would be so kind as to let us have the address and also
 confirm that this is where Paul will be staying.
 
 Many thanks
