 	Vijay:
 
 	I've been trying to call you for about an hour, but the circuits are
 all
 	busy.  Sometimes it's easier for NY to call out than for us to call
 NY.
 	I'll be in my office for about an hour before meetings.  Also, I am
 free
 	in the morning.  We'll need to recall exactly where we were at the
 	beginning of August.  Thanks.  Sara
