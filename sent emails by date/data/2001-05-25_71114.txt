 LOC post-assignment.

 Kay,
 
 Is E-Next Generation LLC the correct entity as beneficiary?

    Chris,
 
    I will get you re-established on PNet, with the correct e-mail address..
    For the B&V folks, I need names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers,
    (nice,
    but not required).
 
    Just a reminder, the site change process can not start until the new
    site
    conditions are identified to GE.  The cost and cycle estimate then takes
    about 4 weeks.
 
    Regards,
