What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility.
 
 
    
 

 		
 
 

   
 
 I think you can skip Deborah's wedding.  Your good excuse is that I have to
 work the next weekend.  Starting on Thursday (the 10th), I have to do Law
 Review stuff until the issue we are working on is finished.  It could be two
 weeks
