 		Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a 
 new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that 
 tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough 
 for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty. 
 Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end 
 grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked 
 against newer competitors. 
 		So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui  horsepower. With this updated, competitive 
 package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of 
 the Dodo.
