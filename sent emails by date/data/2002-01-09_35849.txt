 AND I DO provide her with love and support.  I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st.  Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.  We are going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.  I'm still trying to make her cat disappear.  I'm telling her if that cat leaves one mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.
 
 
 
  

             
    What's going on.... I talked to your women yesterday. She said all you
    do is
    goof off all day.
