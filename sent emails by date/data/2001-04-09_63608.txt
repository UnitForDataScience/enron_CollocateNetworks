 Mr. Lay,
 ?
 Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
 attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
 very much, though, for taking a look at it.

 I have one follow-up question for you  to investigate the  
 opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
 domestically and internationally.?  
 The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
 efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
 initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
 of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
 computational chemistry firms.?
