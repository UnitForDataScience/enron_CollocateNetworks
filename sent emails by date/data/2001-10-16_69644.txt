When are you going to get your hair cut?  I've got a date with Karen this week, well at least I think I do.  Have you talked to Larry about Friday?
 
 

    
 
 Bob,
 
 What about me picking two winning teams last weekend.  Can you send me
 the latest updated version of the pool.  Also what about lunch later
 this week so I can get you your money.  Tell Larry we are going to party
 Friday, so he better go along.
