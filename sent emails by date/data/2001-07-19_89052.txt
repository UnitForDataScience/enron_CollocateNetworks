 Patrice,
 
 Should deal 821869 be booked under Gulf Canada Resources Limited or should it change to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Is there a point at which these deals will permanently remain under Gulf Canada Resources?  If not, can all future deals be moved over to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Please advise.
 
 Thank you,
