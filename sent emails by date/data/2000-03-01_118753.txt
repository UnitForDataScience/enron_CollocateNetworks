 concept.   If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right 
 person.  If it's gas, probably Stacy.

 Comments = I would like to see, in writing, the penalties associated with 
 failure by Enron or the parties doing business on EOL for particular gas 
 trading points.  I have heard verbally from the Calgary office what they 
 consider the penalties to be, however, I haven't seen anything in writing.  I 
 assume that unless parties have agreed to these stated penalies, the 
 penalties would then fall under existing trade agreements.   Is this correct, 
 and is Enron working on specific penalty provisions for EOL deals?
