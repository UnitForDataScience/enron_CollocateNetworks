 Darron,
 
 Befire a book can be added to TAGG, it has to be added to Global Counterparty.
 
 Attached please find an example of a request that is sent Global 
 Counterparty.  Once
 the book is added to Global Counterparty, an e-mail is sent to Ricky Dang 
 from Global
 and he adds to to TAGG.
 
 Give me a call if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks, Ron
