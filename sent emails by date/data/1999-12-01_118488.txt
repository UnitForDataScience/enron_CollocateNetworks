 Aquila Energy (Scott Eckerman (816) 522-1228) called  and wanted to get more 
 clear wording of the few issues in the ETA, i.e. that existing Master always 
 supersedes online GTCs, and that changes we may make to GTCs later on won't 
 affected existing Masters, also that confirmations will be always sent.
 He said they are very excited about online trading with Enron and want to use 
 it ASAP .
 We told him that smone will get back to him today to talk it over. I could 
 not reach neither Louise or David on ext. or mobiles.
