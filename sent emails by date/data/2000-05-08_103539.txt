 Sara:
 
 Last week I had sent you a final version of the memorandum regarding pulp and
 paper transactions (with attachment).  However, this morning I had an
 computer-generated error message regarding that transmission.  I am sending 
 you
 the files again just in case you didn't receive them or couldn't open them.
 
 If you would like a hard copy, please e-mail me back and I will send you a 
 set.
 Thanks.
