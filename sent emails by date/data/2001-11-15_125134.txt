 Jim,
 You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet. This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section. My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning. You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet. If you have any questions just let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
 
  
     
 Good afternoon.
 We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13. Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning. The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
