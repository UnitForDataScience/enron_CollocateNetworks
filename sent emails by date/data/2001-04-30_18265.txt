 (and insightful) comments I received from folks with the great stuff that 
 Dylan put together initially and the stuff that I whipped up. They're 
 attached.  Please proof the thingno pride of ownership, so don't be timid.  Dylan, 
 they are formatted for printing, so all you should have to do is print away.  
 See you all soon.  
 
 Best,
 Jeff
