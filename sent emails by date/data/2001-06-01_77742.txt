 assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
 addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
 the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
 which should help expedite matters.

 I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
 by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
 that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
 should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
 need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
 our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
 I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
 2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 
 
 The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks.
 
  


 
  
 
 Ben:
 
 Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
 via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.
 
 Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
 should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
 have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
 with Seller subject only to consent from GE).
 
 Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,
 
 Michael
