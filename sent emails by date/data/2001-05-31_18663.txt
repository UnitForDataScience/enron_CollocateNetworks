 noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of 
 competing providers for their service, not just Enron.

 LOS ANGELES  has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who 
 have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement 
 forward. 
 State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate 
 energy committee, said there are so many "Plan B's" floating around the 
 Legislature that, "We're going to need to hire an apiculturist." 
 Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration 
 is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of 
 understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's 
 "core and non-core" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions. 
 It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said. 
 Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the 
 chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the 
 Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that 
 could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. 
 "This [plan] would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said. "We just got 
 hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our 
 businesses to other states."
