 Dear Carol:
 
 I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned,
 I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air
 Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read
 about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who
 might be kind enough to "keep their eyes open" and share thoughts and ideas
 as to companies I should contact.
 
 I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As
 you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong
 operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an
 Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.
 I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of
 industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be
 very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest.
 
 Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It
 seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select
 introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who
 can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I
 make, the more opportunities I can uncover.
 
 If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you
 again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your
 help.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Gwen Weddington
