 Good Morning Ruby,
 
      I hope God has found favor with you this morning.  I have a request of
 you.  I don't know if you remember in May when we talked about having a
 women's ministry meeting at your home.  Well, we met briefly last night and
 we are requesting that you, your mother, and aunt allow us to come and share
 with you during the Christmas holiday.  We would like you to co-host the
 meeting in December.  We are looking for a Saturday, due to Pastor Wallace
 having class on Sunday's now.  We would like to know if you would be willing
 to co-host on December 16.  The reason I say co-host, is we always partner
 up with someone.  And we want to afford you the same opportunity.
 
      Our meetings generally consists of prayer, praise and worship.  We
 sing, do bible study and just fellowship with one another.  During
 Christmas, we also do a gift exchange.  We buy one $10 gift for no one in
 particular, put numbers on them and them draw the numbers out of a hat.
 
      We thought the celebration of our Savior's birth would be a good time
 to come and pray with and for your family.  Please let me know.  I hope to
 see you soon.  We really have been missing you.
 
 Be Blessed,
 Denise
