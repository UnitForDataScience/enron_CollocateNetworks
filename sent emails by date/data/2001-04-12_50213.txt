 We spent about an hour  with Rick explaining the rationale behind different=
 =20
 solutions
 and I think he has a better understanding of the models at this point.
 
 I think he was asked by Jeremy to look into it.

 Rick/Vince,
 
 Should this not be a Credit/Research initiative while the business unit=20
 focuses on originating good economic transactions?  Not to be complaining,=
 =20
 but shouldn't EES be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste=20
 resources on a project we are already moving forward on?  You can't run a=
 =20
 portfolio model, unless you have deals in a risk system!  How complex do we=
 =20
 want these MODELS to be?  Behavioral implications on credit default?  They=
 =20
 still don't seem to understand.
 
 Regards,
 Bill
 
 
 Mark - please attend.  You may want to include Martin to help EES understan=
 d=20
 the complexity of their deals.
 
  for that range of companies. However, we a=
 re=20
 dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not=
 =20
 get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it=01,s not like Montgom=
 ery=20
 Ward=01,s where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so=20
 fundamental for a company=01,s success and default actions can be used as a=
  way=20
 to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does no=
 t=20
 neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.
 
 4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for=
  a=20
 life preserver are more likely to live than those that don=01,t. By that I =
 mean=20
 that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th=
 e=20
 credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to=20
 contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn=01,t=
 .=20
 This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn=01,t consider. Th=
 is=20
 would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables=
 =20
 and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.
 
 5) This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special financ=
 e=20
 team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If =
 we=20
 can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a=
 =20
 better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the=
 =20
 current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop=
 =20
 some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.
 
 6) A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments.=20
 Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent=20
 error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random numb=
 er=20
 generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a proble=
 m=20
 in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effe=
 ct=20
 of using different random number generators on Enron=01,s aggregate credit =
 risk?
 
 7) There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improve=
 d"=20
 analysis could make the credit risk be higher.=20
