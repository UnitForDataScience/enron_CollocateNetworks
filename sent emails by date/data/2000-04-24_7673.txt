 Sally,
 Theresa Brogan has been meeting with Kathleen Garcia Spicer under the 
 TEAMLEADERSHIP Program.  Theresa and I are pleased with the progam.
 I would like to request that Clara Carrington be added.  Clara is taking on 
 many new responsibilites assuming the lead for the Rate & Currency Trading 
 Desk and I think that this program would be of assistance in making that 
 transition even more successful.
 
 Okay?
 Thanks. Sheila
