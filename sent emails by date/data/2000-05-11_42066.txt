 Something to bring a smile...<BR>
 &gt;&gt;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A Young man had just gotten his driving permit. He asked 
 his father, a<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; minister if they could discuss the use of the car. His 
 father said,<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I'll make deal with you, You bring up your grades, 
 study your Bible a<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; little, get your hair cut and we'll talk about it.&quot;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; After a month the son asked again about the car. His father 
 said &quot;Son<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I've been real proud of you. You brought up your grades and 
 studied<BR>
 &gt;your<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Bible, but you didn't get your hair cut.&quot;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The young man waited a moment and replied, You know Dad, 
 I've been<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; thinking about that. Samson had long hair, Moses had long 
 hair, and<BR>
 &gt;even<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Jesus had long hair.&quot;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; His father said &quot;Yes, and they walked everywhere they. 
 went.&quot;<BR>
