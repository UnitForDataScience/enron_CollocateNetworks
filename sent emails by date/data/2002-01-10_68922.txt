 Is this value on these deals rought 8K?
 If so, tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a PMA for the gas books.  It is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 12/01.  Are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk?

 Phillip,
 
 Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Susie
