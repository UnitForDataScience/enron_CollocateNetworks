 that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e., 
 European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points.  For 
 example, we'd post  a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01 I think is 
 it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum.  My take is 
 that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to 
 go.  The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria 
 (implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal.
