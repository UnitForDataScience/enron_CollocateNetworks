 know the proper Enron party?  Ed has punted this one to you.  Thanks.
 
 And, I hope things are going well.  I know you'll miss rodeo time here in the 
 Bayou City.  I just received an invitation (courtesy of  Enron) to the BBQ 
 cookoff at the Reliant Astrodome Park (you know, the dome).  I'll bet your 
 mouth is watering.

 Dear Sara & Cheryl,
 
 I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
 International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
 them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.
 
 There had been some question as to which Enron entity
 was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
 information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
 office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
 & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
 International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.
 
 Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
 confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
 whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
 also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
 done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
 get this ISDA started on Enron's part.
 
 Thanks and Regards,
