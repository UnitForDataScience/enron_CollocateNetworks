 Paragraph 11 which covers insurance.  ReUse will be providing ash handling 
 services under this agreement.  This same agreement will be used for both  
 Lumbertown Power, LLC and Elizabethtown Power, LLC.  These are the power 
 plants in the Alamac transaction.  We are looking at replacing the existing 
 Ash and Coal handling agreements with new ones.  Let me know if you have any 
 questions.
