 Thanks.

 Objet : Document you sent to Enron 
 
 Hello, Maud! 
 My name is Becky Spencer and I work for Brent Hendry.  In answer to your 
 question of this morning, yes, Brent did receive the document you sent to 
 him on April 12th.  Could you please let us know the name of the contact 
 person here at Enron to whom you have been speaking so we can better 
 coordinate our discussions with you? 
 Thank you!  We look forward to doing business with you.
