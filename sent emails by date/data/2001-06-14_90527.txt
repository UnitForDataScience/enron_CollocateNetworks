 Jeanne,
 I will be moving in about six weeks from Louisiana to the Woodlands. Just wanted to find out the amount of time required to set the move up. Drop me a line when you get a chance.
 Thanks,
 Keith

 Kim,
 
 Keith was assigned to Jeanne Seward as his consultant.
 I have passed the note to Jeanne so that she can contact Keith and get all going.
  
 Thanks,

 Deborah, approximately a year ago, Keith came on board to Enron but at the time we deferred his relocation package.   After speaking to Keith today, he will soon need to commence on his plan and will need for you to contact him in order for everything to flow smoothly.  Can you contact Keith to discuss the timeline?  He can be reached at x33311.  Thanks!
