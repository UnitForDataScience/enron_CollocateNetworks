 Any thoughts on this?

 Lucy,
 
 I work with Bill Gautreaux at Inergy Services.  I am working on several
 proposals in which historical degree day averages are needed.  Would you
 be able to provide the 10 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and 30 degree day averages
 (ending with calendar 1999) for the following locations.
 
 Raliegh, NC
 Chattanooga, TN
 Fort Wayne, IN
 Chicago, IL
 Detroit, MI
 
 You have recently provided us with some of the information above, but I
 am missing several components.
 
 I can be reached at 816-741-5080 if you have any questions.
 
 I appreciate your help in providing the information.
