 s=20
 in Sacramento, I suspect that these legislators are likely to be extremely=
 =20
 cranky at this event (assuming they're not forced to cancel due to the=20
 continued inability to find an answer).  Under the circumstances, I would=
 =20
 suggest that it's likely not the best forum for us.  Might be best to let t=
 he=20
 legislators slow roast a bit.  If we feel compelled to participate, I sugge=
 st=20
 Steve Kean.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
