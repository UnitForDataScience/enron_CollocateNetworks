 Ken's already strapped for time and we've giving him an aggressive list of 
 CEOs to call (he probably won't make more than a handful of calls).  If you 
 could call Peevey, that would be great.

 Yes.  And I'd be happy to call him and harass him.  Better yet, if Ken Lay's 
 willing to call him and harass him, that'd be better still. 
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff/Janel/Paul  how about a call to him 
 asking him to weigh in w/ Davis.  Also, Peevey's wife is a freshman 
 assemblywoman (Carol Liu, I think).  So I think Peevey is a key influential.  
 What do you think? kd
