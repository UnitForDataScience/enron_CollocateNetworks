 EL CENTRO, Calif. enough to supply 268,000 homes.
 
 Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about 
 12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes. 
 Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells 
 that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground. Magma rising in 
 fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 The generating plants convert the water to "live" steam, the pressure of 
 which turns turbines to produce electricity. The plants then return the 
 slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a 
 renewable resource.
 
 CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a 
 group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore 
 options to collect back payments from Edison. Together, the group is owed 
 more than $300 million by Edison.
