 I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
 it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
 I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
 they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
 information she still needs from us, I think.  
 I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.
  any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
 I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

 Here's my best shot(s):
 
 
 NatCom Energy Services, Inc.
 
 Streamline Energy Services, Inc.
 
 Handyman Energy Services, Inc.
 
 Enable Energy Services, Inc.  (var. Enerable)
