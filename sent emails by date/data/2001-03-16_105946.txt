 Attached please find the revised Transfer and Assumption Agreement.  Please
 disregard the earlier version, a rider send from Enron was inadvertently
 omitted.  Please note that the signature pages are now ready for signing, for
 those who wish to sign and hold the pages in escrow.   I have enclosed a
 blackline against both the version sent earlier today and the version sent 
 last
 night for your convenience.  Please not that this agreement is being sent to 
 all
 parties simultaneously, thus there may be further comments.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Kate
