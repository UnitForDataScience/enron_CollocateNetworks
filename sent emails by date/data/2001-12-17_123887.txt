 Thanks for the offer, I have a Dr's appt.  Maybe later this week.
 
 Mid C is R9, but WSCC-N is R8.  A 'B' indicates a basis curve which WSCC-N is not.
 
 Have you talked to Bruce from Chase re: these files?

 What is the curve code for WSCC-N
 
 Also, do you have the breakdown for BPA volumes by peak and non-peak and reference date?
 
 
 Thanks
 Frank
