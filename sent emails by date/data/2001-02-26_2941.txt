 personal business.

 I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent
 investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
 private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net
 worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
 structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then
 provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
 money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide
 the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
 to the appropriate indices.
 
 I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
 previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
 was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I
 would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more
 detail.  How does 4 PM sound?

 Michael:
 Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
 really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
 bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
 premium.
 I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
 and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
 was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
 to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
 into that for me.
 John.

 I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
 opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
 in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not

 interested.
