
 
 Mark,
 
 As I mentioned in my voice mail, here is a bullet-point synopsis of my 
 accomplishments for the second half of 2000.  
 
 Transaction Support
 
 Triple Lutz  have met with most of OGC and 
 will have a staffing plan finalized in the next week.
 Provided real-time legal review of HR-related E-Speak sessions.
 
 I haven't included what I consider to be routine responsibilities such as 
 providing advice on employee relations issues, attending off-sites/staff 
 meetings for Olson/Oxley, attending CLE, etc.  Let me know if you would like 
 more information about these activities.  If you have any questions, or if 
 you would like a summary of accomplishments from the first half of the year, 
 let me know.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Michelle
