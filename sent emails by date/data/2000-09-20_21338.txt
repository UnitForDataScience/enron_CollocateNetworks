 through the Regulatory report and iniatives.

 Unless we hear concerns from you, we plan to lend Enron's name to the 
 attached letter to the Congressional leadership opposing the MidAmerican 
 attempt to pass modified, stand-alone PUHCA repeal.  Others signing-on so far 
 include:  ELCON, TAPS, Calpine, City Utilities of Springfield, Consumers for 
 Fair Competition, Missouri River Energy Services, and Northern California 
 Power Agency.  The letter is to be sent Thursday, September 21st so please 
 advise if you have concerns no later than close of business the day before.
 
 Thanks.
