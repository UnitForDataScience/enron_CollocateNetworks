 available.  I think that Bracewell may be looking for people, as might 
 Littler, Mendelson.  I hope that helps. Michelle

 Trey,
 
 I have a friend that is a 5th year lawyer who has 4 years of labor and 
 employment experience with a large law firm and a labor boutique firm (both 
 here in town)- this person has asked me if Enron might have a need for a 
 labor and employment lawyer with these kind of credentials.  Would you pretty 
 please ask your wife if she is aware of any potential opportunities.  
 
 Thanks - Tara
