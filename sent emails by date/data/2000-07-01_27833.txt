 Susan,
 
 Per your request, I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option 
 exemptions and regulations.  If you have any questions or comments you would 
 like to discuss before the 3 p.m. meeting please do not hesitate to contact 
 me.  If the offer still stands, I would like to attend this afternoon's 
 meeting.
