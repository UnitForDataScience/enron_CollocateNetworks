 Alan and Matt, I have reviewed David Best's bill and find it in order.  I 
 recommend that it be placed in line for payment as well.

 Joya:
 
 Please process this payment. I think we will be charging it to the Litigation 
 RC. Please check with Twanda/Richard to confirm this.
 
 Thanks, Alan

 I shall be forwarding WFW's bill (which includes PacMarine's bill) to Houston 
 (for Joya Davis' attention) for payment of a reduced sum (SGD112,000 for 
 WFW's legal fees). A credit note will be issued to us upon payment.
 
 Britt - I don't have any comments on Clyde & Co's bill. If you are OK with 
 it, I'll similarly forward thier bill to Joya to process payment. Please let 
 me know.
 
 Thanks and regards
 Matt

 Further to my earlier note, the rest of WFW's bill is for PacMarine's costs 
 (SGD18,827.35 reduced from an earlier SGD25,000) which I also think is fair 
 and reasonable.
 
 Regards
 Matt

 I met with Neale Gregson this afternoon to discuss WFW's bill. We went 
 through the bill item by item and I am satisfied that it is fair given the 
 amount of work actually done. It is nevertheless  a hefty bill, so I did ask 
 Neale for some accomodation. He has agreed to reduce the charges from 
 SGD120,000 to SGD112,000. I should be xpecting a credit note from WFW. I 
 trust this is acceptable to you as well. Please let me know.
 
 Regards
 Matt
