 	Good morning.  I have a price discrepancy for deal 120644/120643,
 Anschutz Plant, for 8/01 and 9/01 (and if it is not corrected, we could have
 a discrepancy for as long as the deal lasts, until 4/02).  Enron is showing
 the rate to be Inside FERC NWPL Rockies + $0.02 less $0.09 (Mcf conversion).
 In ET Deal our formula is (NWPL Rocky Mountains IF) + .02 - ((1.022-.995) *
 (Kern Wyoming IF)).
 
 	Can you please verify who is correct, and if Enron's rate is
 correct, can you please make the changes for 8/01, 9/01 and the continuing
 months in the deal?  If we are correct, can you please talk to your
 counterpart at Enron to see about getting this resolved this month?  My
 counterpart and I would both like to have this rate discrepancy cleared this
 month.
 
 	Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank
 you for all your help.
 
 	Thanks-
