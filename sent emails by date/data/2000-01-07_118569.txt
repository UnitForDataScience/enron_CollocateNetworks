  We have reviewed the Reference Price Sources for the commodities
 that have been assigned to us.  I will forward our changes, amendments and
 updates under separate cover.
 
  In the course of reviewing the Price Sources, we came across one
 issue that was not discussed on the recent conference call, but is one about
 which we have strong feelings.  We believe that the Price Source used for a
 particular commodity should reflect the geographic source of the commodity,
 e.g., Platt's Asia-Pacific for Asian commodities, Platt's European,
 Marketscan or Platt's Crude Marketwire for European commodities and Platt's
 Oilgram for North American commodities.  While reviewing the Reference Price
 Sources for Fuel Oil, we found that in many cases only Platt's Oilgram is
 listed, even though the product is European or Asian.  We would prefer to
 delete the references to Platt's Oilgram for products outside of North
 America.  However, we understand that such a step cannot be taken without a
 discussion with the wider group (which may not be feasible at this point).
 If such a discussion is not feasible, we would like (if possible) to include
 the European or Asian-Pacific price source in the Supplement along with the
 U.S. price source for all products (including those commodities we have not
 reviewed and commented on).
 
  I apologize for bringing this issue up so late in the process.
 Please call me, Keir Prince (011 44 171 774 5004) or Aaron Marcus (357-9514)
 if you would like to discuss.
