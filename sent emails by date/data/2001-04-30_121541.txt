    Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our
    potential
    natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and
    would
    like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.
 
    As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid
    daily
    price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing
    market
    warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in
    the
    form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
    constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years
    of
    daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information
    when
    submitting your final proposal.
 
    Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.
 
    Regards,
 
    Monica V. Padilla
