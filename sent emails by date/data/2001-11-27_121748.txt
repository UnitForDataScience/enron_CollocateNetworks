 Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.  I know that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.  Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our pipe.  I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help you.
 
 Thanks for keeping me posted,
 Kim.  
 
 
 
 

    Agreement - Revised 
 
 
 Hi Kim.
 Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
 vote
 yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
 At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
 approved,
 and may opt to resubmit.
 Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
 the
 ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
 Commissioners....major blunder.
 I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
 If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
 agreement,
 etc.
 Best regards,
 Kirk
