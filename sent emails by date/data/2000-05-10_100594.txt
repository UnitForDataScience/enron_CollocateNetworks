 continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,"  and 
 replace Section 3 with "Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon 
 written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to 
 the intended date of termination."
 
 Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft.

 Looks like you nailed the least cost billing provision pretty good.  Just 
 need to abrogate our remaining term and make all agreements evergreen.

 Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of 
 an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring 
 you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me 
 know and I will fax it to you.  
 
 In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
 described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
 if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
 then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
 for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
 handling, and I appreciate your patience.
