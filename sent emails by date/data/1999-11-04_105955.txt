 Thanks Lauren, this was really quick.
 
 Mary, it would be useful if you could fill out the Jardine form and send it 
 to us. 
 
 We want to send the filled up form and the Officer Certifiacte from Wade only 
 when we give in our bid to Jardine.

 The Cayman Islands entity to own the GDR has been set up.  It's name is Enron 
 India GDR Holding Ltd.  It is owned by Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.  You may 
 use 333 Clay Street, 19th Floor, Houston, Texas as a general business 
 address.  There is no need to send things to the Cayman Islands.
