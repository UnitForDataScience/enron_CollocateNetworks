 Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for 
 November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown 
 in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I 
 won't execute these until I hear from you.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff 
 gave us the OK on this one.
