 I don't remember where this one is being held. If it's near StF I could
 probably drop him off and pick him up. Do you know the hours?
 Or, what do you think about me asking Charlotte to switch days? NM

 Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know
 Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt
 to take off and bring him.  Thanks for the invitation.
