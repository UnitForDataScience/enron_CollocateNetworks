
 
 Can't thank you enough.  Great report and I wish that I'd been there with you 
 to experience it.  I'd like to stay in touch.  It's a high priority of mine 
 to come down there (as I've mentioned a few times).  I'm going to try and do 
 it before the month's out.  I hope we can have lunch or something and compare 
 notes about all this stuff.  This won't be going away for quite some time.
 
 Thanks again for your help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hi, Jeff   If any of this doesn't make sense or you have 
 additional questions, please let me know. I have a few things scribbled in 
 the margins that may help piece it together better.
 
 Again, thanks for the opportunity to help.  I look forward to talking to 
 you again soon.
 
 Best,
 
 Dana
