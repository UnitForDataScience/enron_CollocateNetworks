 I forgot to pack Michael's speech/language notebook this am.  I did remind
 him that today is a Mary Lou day.  He wants Paige to pick him up, but I
 don't know how that could work.
 
 The cars are moving on the Pearce Elevated.  You are probably right - you
 could go quickest on 10 assuming no construction problems, as 610 may be
 crowded.  I wish I would have thought to drive in that way this am.
 
 It is Bosses Day, and there is so much food around here.  I'm on my second
 cookie, and I won't even mention the sausage balls and 7 layer dip.
 
 Love,
