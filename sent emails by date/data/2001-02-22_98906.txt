 All three arbitrators are okay with the week of August 20th.  How does it 
 look at your end? Also, do we want a "reasoned opinion" or just a "decision" 
 from them?  Since there are few, if any grounds for an appeal, McDade 
 recommends a "decision". Ileana

 Ileana,
 
 As of now, my calendar is clear for August 20th.  I will pencil this in,
 although I think we should make sure that everybody also has the 21st open
 in case the arbitration takes more than one day.  We will, of course, need
 to have Max Yzaguirre available.  Even though we are posturing the case as
 a summary judgment case, I think it would also be helpful to have Dwight
 Beach and Steve Irwin available.  They would be the two best witnesses, I
 think, to discuss all of the things that McKenna had not done in order to
 have a viable project.  I believe this type of testimony would be helpful
 to the arbitrators so that they would know that, in ruling on the contract
 interpretation as a matter of law, they are also ruling in a fundamentally
 fair manner
