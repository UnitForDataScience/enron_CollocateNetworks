 draft was around the beginning of April.  I can check for more specifics.

 Dear Kay and Dale,
  Peter Thompson is on vacation and has asked me to make the
 attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
 straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
 couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and
 I'd like to make sure I've got the right one before I start making
 changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and
 I'll take care of the rest.  Thank you, Chris

 Bill,
 
 In reviewing these documents we find that these changes were not
 incorporated.  Could you please make certain they are included.
 
 Thanks
 
 Paul
