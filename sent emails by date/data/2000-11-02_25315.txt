 I didn't pay any attention to the date on this message.  We should be able to 
 handle this on our side with out involving the East Desk.  If the OBA can be 
 used, apply the volume there.  If nothing else, we can write it off.

 Jackie, 
 
 Please get with the East Desk on this.  If they agree, we can roll the deal.

 Daren,
 
 On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.
 
 6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
 for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
 Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?
 
 Thanks
