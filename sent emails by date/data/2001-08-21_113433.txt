 I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August=
  8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything. =20
 
 Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso=
 ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve S=
 wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is t=
 o have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th. =20
 
 Current Issues:=20
 1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undeterm=
 ined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)
 
 2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E =
 is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not)=20
 3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX =
 clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised =
 PX credits=20
 
 4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D=20
 5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charg=
 es), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions
 
 6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE=20
 
 
 The four proposals are as follows:=20
 
 SCE Recommended Approach=20
         This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 1=
 8, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the=
   gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed=
 .   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no    generation/c=
 ommodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent) =
  will be applicable to Direct Access customers. =20
 
         Enron would request the following:=20
         1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to=
  EES or EEMC=20
         2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an "all=
 owable claim" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p=
 ossible. =20
 
         3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument=20
         4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit =
 Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility=
  parent   level.=20
 
         5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if=
 /when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC=20
 
         Other consideration:=20
         Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concer=
 n re CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20
 
 
 PG&E Recommended Approach=20
         This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu=
 ary 18, 2001 would include an "avoided cost"  component.  This avoided cost=
  =20
 
         component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDW=
 R purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchase=
 s.        This resulting "avoided cost" would be used in lieu of the PX cle=
 aring price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDW=
 R purchase  costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embe=
 dded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation. =20
 
        =20
         Enron would request the following:=20
         Same as above=20
 
         Other Consideration:=20
         Enron  would continue to be exposed to "price" risk attributable to=
  the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would h=
 amper     Enron's ability         to hedge the positions in the retail port=
 folio.=20
 
 Hybrid Approach=20
         This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from Jan=
 uary 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is       =
   applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary=
  as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa=
 l.=20
 
         Enron would request the following:=20
         Same as SCE and PG&E approach=20
 
         Other considerations:=20
         Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concer=
 n re CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20
 
 
 Enron Model=20
         This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 a=
 nd SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.  =20
 
         Enron would request the following:=20
         It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe=
 r PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial =
 is        the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   Howev=
 er, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the=
  "value"    Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti=
 es and CPUC.
 
         Other considerations:=20
         This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge "price" risk, b=
 ut this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated wit=
 h the     actual collection of the PX credit.
 
 
 Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu=
 ded in Wednesday's meeting.=20
 
 Thanks,=20
