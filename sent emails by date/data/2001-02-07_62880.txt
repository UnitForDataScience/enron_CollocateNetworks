 Neil,
 	We are still moving ahead with our consultant to get the resumes of the Duke traders.  The bonus season at Duke occurs towards the end of this month, and all the candidates have explicitly told us that they are waiting to share their resumes only until after their bonuses are distributed.  We'll keep on top of it and advise.
