 Luiz:
 I have reviewed the documents you distributed on Friday regarding Enron's
 position on interregional coordination.  In general, we agree with Enron's
 position with the following exceptions.  We do believe that the
 consolidation of "control areas" is a useful objective in the context of
 creating a greater SE RTO, and, in fact, is inconsistent with Enron's
 support of the CACTF's reliability model.  The RTO should also not be a
 central dispatcher.  Its control of generation should be limited to
 redispatch for congestion management and the maintenance of short-term
 reliability.  The basic premise behind the CACTF model is that control
 areas are becoming obsolete and unbundled.  Control area consolidation
 risks rebundling the industry and this would stifle innovation and market
 dynamics.  Our efforts should be directed at ensuring adequate independence
 of balancing, security and interchange authorities.  This should be done by
 FERC because NERC has no authority (or inclination) to do so.
