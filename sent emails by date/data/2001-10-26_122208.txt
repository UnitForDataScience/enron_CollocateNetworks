 Hi Kim,
 
 	I'd like to schedule 10 mintues of your time so we can adjust your Business Objects file locations to the new ETS Marketing standard configuration.  When's a good time for you?  I'm available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday.  I'd like to help you complete this configuration as soon as possible.
 
 
 Thanks,
 -Ed
