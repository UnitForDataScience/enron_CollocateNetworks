 Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
 Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
 Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
 Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
 schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
 our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
 national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
 possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
 students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
 a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
 classes.? 
 
 Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
 seeing you once again. 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jim Garven
