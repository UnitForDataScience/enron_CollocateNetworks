 Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
 assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
 appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.
 
 Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
 documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
 half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
 out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
 difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
 unique to systems at PECO.
 
 We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
 bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
 out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?
