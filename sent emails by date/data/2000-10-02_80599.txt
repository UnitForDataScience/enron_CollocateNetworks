 really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 50%, its a negotiation 
 item. Or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free.  
 After your follow-up meetings, please let me know if we need to get more 
 involved.

 Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
 plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
 have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
 the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
 from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
 related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
 may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
 relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
 this terminal
 
 We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
 thoughts or suggestions
 
 Rick
