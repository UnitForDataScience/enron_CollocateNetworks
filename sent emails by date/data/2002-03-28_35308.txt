 The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.
 
 I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
 This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

 (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth
 per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to
 The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I
 prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

 Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion
 was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying
 any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson
 Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.

 with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in
 the past.  He will fax a letter to me.
