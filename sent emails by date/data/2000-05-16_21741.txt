 is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable 
 display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community 
 and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front, 
 expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and 
 budgeted next.
 
 Let discuss

 Delainey
