 I don't want to drag Lou into this discussion again.

 My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
 WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
 to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
 Key points for discussion will be:
 
 -brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
 -brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
 through wholesale
 -discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
 proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
 retail business a success:
  -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
  -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake
 
 
 Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
 Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
 try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
 involved present on the call/meeting.
