 Maharashtra to pay Rs 788cr penalty to MSEB, Girish Kuber=20
 =20
 MAHARASHTRA has decided to pay Rs 788 crore to the ailing Maharashtra State=
  Electricity Board to compensate it for the damage it has caused the power =
 utility through tariff concessions to various sectors. Padmasinh Patil, the=
  state's energy minister, had wanted to give tariff concessions to farmers,=
  which was objected to by MSEB. Even the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory=
  Commission asked the state's energy department to restrain its generosity.=
  The MERC had asked the government not to offer concessions at the cost of =
 its SEB and directed it to make a budgetary provision if it wanted to go ah=
 ead with its plan. Accordingly, Mr Patil announced last year that the state=
  government will compensate the board. The MERC had set a deadline of Octob=
 er 2001 for sanctioning the compensation. The supplementary demand presente=
 d to the state assembly makes this provision. "It has been decided to give =
 subsidy to MSEB to compensate the loss arising from supplying electricity a=
 t concessional rate to agricultural and powerloom consumers with effect fro=
 m May 1, 2000," said the demand by the state's finance ministry.=20
 
 Currently, concessions of 55 per cent and 33.33 per cent in the electricity=
  bills is given to powerloom and agricultural consumers. The total expendit=
 ure involved in the proposal is estimated to be around Rs 788 crore. The is=
 sue of offering concessions to powerloom and agriculture consumers has been=
  hanging fire for the last couple of years. The board last year had raised =
 the tariff for agriculture and powerloom consumers which was opposed by the=
  state government for obvious reasons. The government announced a roll-back=
  of the tariff hike only to be prevented by the MERC from doing so. The MSE=
 B will now be charging Rs 600 per one horse power pump, bringing down the r=
 ate from Rs 1,400, and Rs 185 per loom down from the earlier rate of Rs 300=
 . The government has also decided to waive 55 per cent of the Rs 110 crore =
 unpaid dues from powerlooms. Delayed payment charges for the defaulters has=
  also been waived and they have been granted three instalments for clearing=
  old dues. According to MSEB's own admission, more than 118 lakh of the tot=
 al 130 lakh consumers are being supplied subsidised power.=20
