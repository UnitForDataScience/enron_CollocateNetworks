 Jodie,
 
 The attached file contains the LS Power Whitewater's hourly rate from 12/20/01 to 6/17/01.  If you need data prior to 6/17/01 we will have retrieve it from microfiche.  The file has a column for the scan hour, hourly rate, and a YES if the hour exceeded 1900.0 mcf per hour.  If you have any questions call me at x31534
