 Please, take a look at it.

   the 
 rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets 
 (electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).
 
 It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a 'value judgement' or am I 
 wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate 
 this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or 
 likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it 
 becomes non arm's length and does not pass the smell test?
 
 Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also 
 be appreciated.

 Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever 
 asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them 
 was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a 
 knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange 
 for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This 
 structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didn't 
 necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco, 
 Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was 
 about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for 
 quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to 
 Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.
 
 I hope this helps.
