 I believe we did the initial survey in 1996-97 in Mexico (Sara and I worked 
 on it together), cobering financial and physical trading. I don't know if 
 there have been any updates since that time. You should check with Steve Van 
 Hooser, Sara Shackleton and Peggy Banczak. I do not have any issues to add to 
 the original survey.

 We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the 
 online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going 
 to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original 
 advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for 
 advice?
