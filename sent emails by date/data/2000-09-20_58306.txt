 to Cal-ISO for
   minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said.
 
   SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity 
 as possible, and
   grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other 
 power use to comply.
 
   "We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take 
 seriously," Pam Bass,
   SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as 
 electricity use
   soared Monday. "If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be 
 directed by
   the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone 
 needs to cut their
   use of power now to avoid forced outages."
 
   Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting 
 peak use of
   44,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 44,537 megawatts 
 on
   Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total 
 lower.
 
   "We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today," SCE 
 spokeswoman Karen
   Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 
 17,860
   megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut 
 2,500
   megawatts of electricity. "It got really touchy today," she said.
