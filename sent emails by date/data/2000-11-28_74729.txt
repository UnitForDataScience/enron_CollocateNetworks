 Hi there,
 
 I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.
 
 Here are some questions/comments:
 
 I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
 =20
 I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
 =20
 rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
 f=20
 the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
 familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
 rk=20
 on it.=20
 
 I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially=20
 similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.
 
 Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.
 
 I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
 standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
 =20
 can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.
 
 I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
 he=20
 assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
 d=20
 financials, but I didn't comment there.
 
 I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
 own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
 "construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.
 
 Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):
 
 
 
 Except for as described in Section hereto.  Any failure to respond in writing withi=
 n=20
 the foregoing period shall be deemed to constitute consent.
 
 When duly assigned in accordance with this Article, (including, following a=
 ny=20
 collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee), (i) th=
 is=20
 Agreement or the rights and/or obligations so assigned shall be binding upo=
 n=20
 and shall inure to the benefit of the assignee (and all rights and/or=20
 obligations so assigned, including, without limitation, any and all warrant=
 y=20
 rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee were an=20
 original party hereto), (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably relieved of=
 =20
 and forever discharged from all liability under this Agreement so long as t=
 he=20
 assignee executes an assumption of this Agreement and such liabilities and=
 =20
 obligations herein, and (iii) Seller shall look only to such assignee for t=
 he=20
 performance of the obligations so assigned.  Any assignment other than as=
 =20
 permitted herein shall be void and without force or effect.
