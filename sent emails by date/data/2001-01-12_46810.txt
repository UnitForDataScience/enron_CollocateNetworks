 Attached please find another draft of confidentiality agreement revised to 
 (i) change the DealBench counterparty to its parent, Enron Net Works LLC, and 
 (ii) make the agreement mutual in respect of Bridge Confidential 
 Information.  I understand that DealBench (which continues to be protected 
 under this agreement) would like to disclose information this afternoon to 
 Bridge.  Accordingly, please fax a signed Bridge counterpart as soon as 
 possible to me at the fax number below and to Jeff Bartlett at 713/646-8576.  
 We will fax to you a counterpart signed by Net Works.
 
 Regards, NJD
