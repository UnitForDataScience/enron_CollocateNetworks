 Hi Chris,
 I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
 whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
 still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
 McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
 (5-3910) or email me.
 Thanks,
 Shemin
