        Hey Cooper, 
    I remember you telling me your address,  so I really hope this is it.  I 
    guess I could call you,  but it's more fun to e-mail...especially at 
    work.  Deloitte just gave me a new laptop....the perks of working for a 
    prestigious law firm!!!  Stephanie and I even got a dozen cookies each 
    from Cookies by George yesterday.  It's  a good way to make friends in 
    an office full of vultures (almost worse than Earls!). 
    Are you still going to yoga tomorrow??  So far,  Janice, Jaimie, 
    Stephanie and I are going.  I know it's alot of women.  But don't worry, 
    I told them all about "naked yoga" and they're okay with it. 
    Next time I see you I'll give you that book,  Tuesdays with Morrie.  I 
    am almost done.  It's an amazing book.  It is simple,  but in it's 
    simplicity it is so profound.  Wow,  that might have been a little too 
    deep for e-mail,  but you get the point.  It's an easy read.  Jai should 
    probably read it too. 
    Hey,  how are your Scooby snacks???  Are you bringing them to work?  Are 
    the stickers plastered all over your apartment and car yet??  I sure 
    hope so. 
    Talk to you later, 
    Emily
