 > Mike Billings has given us your name as the first contact person in Enron
 > to negotiate an ISDA agreement with The Dow Chemical Company (TDCC).  Our
 > files show an ISDA between Enron Capital & Trade Resources and two Dow
 > entities (Dow Hydrocarbons & Resources, and Dow Chemical Canada). In
 > addition to this, my understanding is that TDCC (my predecessor in this
 > position) and Enron ( presumably a lawyer) had some discussions about an
 > ISDA, but for some reason they were not successful. Despite this, the
 > level of trading between the two companies have increased and TDCC has
 > never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the
 > confirmations sent by Enron. For these reasons, we think we should agree
 > on an ISDA where conditions acceptable to both parties can apply to the
 > intense trading between the two companies.

 > discussion. Please forward this message to the responsible person asking
 > him to contact me for any discussion. Thanks.
