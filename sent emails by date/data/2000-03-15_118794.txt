 Joe,
 
 In talking with Nick yesterday evening, I learned that most people are off in 
 Japan during the week of May 1.  April 29 and May 3 through 5 are all 
 national holidays (Greenery Day, Constitution Day, National Holiday and 
 Children's Day respectively).  Furthermore, Nick advises that many people 
 start the holiday week early and stretch it into the following week.  This 
 makes our selection of May 1 week for EOL a most unsatisfactory choice.   I 
 would recommend that we shoot for May 10 or 11 (which would conflict with 
 possible high profile participation in an APEC meeting, which I'll be 
 managing) or preferably the week of May 15.  We could introduce EOL earlier, 
 but publicity would be reduced given Rebecca's schedule for interviews and 
 lead time for printing/mailing promotional packets.  It would be very tight, 
 but we could do it the week of April 24.  Rebecca could provide overview 
 interviews, supplemented by an EOL demonstration and your explanation of how 
 this provides a platform to build our business.  Do you have 
 preferences/limitations from a business activity perspective?  Unless you 
 object, on Monday I'll get recommendations from our PR firm and also check 
 Louise's availability/desire to be part of the EOL introduction.
