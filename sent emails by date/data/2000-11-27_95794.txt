 Attached is a summation of the WSCC Executive Policy Issues Task Force 
 meeting held in San Francisco on November 2,  In addition there are several 
 attachnebts that will be voted on at the Board meeting in December including 
 the By Laws for the formation of the WIO.  It is anticipated that the WIO 
 will be ready for a FERC filing during the 1s half of 2001  There is a large 
 amt of material and some of it needs review by legal in my opinion.   Note 
 that we voted  "no" on the EHV ballot  because it restricts access to 
 information.  The bylaws and the detail documents are most critical for legal 
 review.  For clarity read them in the following order:  EPITF Nov 2;  
 wiosummary; bylaws;detail doc.  If there aqre questions you can call me at
