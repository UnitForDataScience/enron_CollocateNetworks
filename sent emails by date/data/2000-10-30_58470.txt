 Well, it seems that eThink has another hit.  Twelve people have already put 
 well-conceived business ideas into the ThinkBank and we have received 
 numerous congratulatory calls.  I won't have site hits until next week, but 
 the active participation has been the highest of all our current applications 
 on their respective launch day.
 
 Have a great weekend,
 Sarah.
