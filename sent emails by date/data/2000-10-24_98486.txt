  but if not, Elizabeth does and we should
 get our arms around it.
 
 I'm going to be messengering to you today the Trust's mediation statement 
 filed
 in connection with the other defendants.  I only have a fax, and if I fax it 
 to
 you, you won't be able to read it.  It would be beneficial for you to review
 this statement as it sets forth the Trustee's position in more detail.    It
 provides the basis for their claim of unjust enrichment, even though I 
 continue
 to believe that unjust enrichment is not available in connection with the 
 Master
 Agreement and EPMI's termination for unpaid invoices.
 
 I also think it would be helpful to connect Liz Austin into our conversation 
 on
 Wednesday so that she can advise you of her experience in mediating with the
 Trustee.  She has represented at least one other defendant who mediated with 
 the
 Trust successfully.  Her insights of what to expect will be helpful.
 
 Thanks.
