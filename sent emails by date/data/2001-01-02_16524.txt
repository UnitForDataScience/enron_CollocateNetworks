 at some point and I can drop that info into the document soon as I get it.
 Will talk to EES at 10 AM CST to discuss their proposals.  If you'd like to 
 join that call, let me know and I'll forward along the call-in number, which 
 I think you may already have in your email.
 Have received a few comments from ENA that I'll incorporate.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
