   definitely slower than early last year," said Bill Huie, assistant vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas. "With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement." 
 The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. "Our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter," said Roger Dick, spokesman for Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight, Duluth, Ga. 
 USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nation's "serious economic slowdown," said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall "very substantially below" current Wall Street consensus. 
 Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added. 
 "Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being the strongest month of the period," Skinner said in a statement. "This year, the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months." 
 It's not just the LTL industry that's hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand. 
 "So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply," Valentine wrote in his most recent "Trucking Snapshot" for early March. 
 Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was "masked by the strong economy," Valentine says. 
 In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts. 
 The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months. Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a "two-for-one" sale on three- to five-year-old Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand new Chevy Suburban SUV. 
 What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a 100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets. 
 The glut may last for a while, according to Valentine's analysis. Assuming a three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year. That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy. 
 "We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these factors, we expect USFreightways' profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts' forecasts," Skinner said. 
 In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle, rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies, Skinner added. 
 Expectations at each of USF's operating companies have been affected, some more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year, Skinner said. 
 Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be "accelerated" in the wake of the softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said. 
 "We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further impeding progress in this area," Skinner said. "During the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force. These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions." 
 In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time, that was USF's 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned $23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

 Market             What's Going On
 MSDW [*] truckload Remains in record-low territory, indicating
 freight index      the worst demand-supply relationship since MSDW
                    began tracking the date in April 1994.
 Diesel prices      Diesel prices in the first quarter of 2001
                    have come down 6% sequentially from 4Q00. However,
                    the average price for the quarter remains 6%
                    above that of 1Q00.
 WTI oil            OPEC recently agreed to reduce supply by 5% and
                    has stated a price objective of $25 per barrel.
 Capacity           Retail sales of Class 8 tractors (new trucks
                    entering the market) came down in January, but
                    inventory (trucks that will enter the market at some 
                    point) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3.4 months

                    for 1Q01 and 2Q01, respectively.
 Retail sales       Retail sales rose 0.7% in January. While this
                    was better than forecast, the upside was likely
                    the result of excessive clearance sales after a
                    disappointing holiday season.
 Consumer           The Conference Board's measure of consumer
 confidence         confidence fell again (nine points) in February
                    after registering the largest one-month decline
                    in 10 years in January (14 points).
 NAPM               The February NAPM rose slightly to 41.9.

 Market             Implications
 MSDW [*] truckload Negative for all TL carriers.
 freight index
 Diesel prices      The downward trend is Positive for all
                    carriers, especially TL carriers, which have
                    greater exposure to fuel than LTL carriers.
 WTI oil            Negative for all carriers, as $25 per
                    barrel is still 25% higher than the $20 per
                    barrel average since 1990.
 Capacity           Negative for TL carriers, not a major
                    concern for LTL carriers, which measure
                    capacity by the number of terminals.
 GDP                Negative for all carriers.
 Retail sales       Negative for both TI and LTL carriers.
 Consumer           Negative for all carriers

 Stock              Positive, however, stocks could pull
