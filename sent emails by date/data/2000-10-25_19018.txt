 Tim,
 
 Thanks for forwarding me the contract.  In Section 3(a), there is a=20
 definition for "Post-Rolloff Period" which states, "shall mean, with respec=
 t=20
 to each Facility, the period of time commencing with the day after the last=
 =20
 day of the Pre-Rolloff Period.....but not including any extension period=20
 pursuant to Section 3(g)(ii).  The problem is that I cannot find Section=20
 3(g)(i) in the contract.
 
 Further, the definition of "Pre-Rolloff Period" which states, "...ending on=
 =20
 the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs (but=
 =20
 excluding residual CTCs) in its service territory under AB1890," is=20
 ambiguous.  There are two possible solutions.  One possible solution is to=
 =20
 define the term "residual CTCs".  Another solution is to redraft the langua=
 ge=20
 to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section 367 and 368 enacted by=
 =20
 AB1890.

 You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period=
 =20
 ends differently than we expect.
 
 The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with=
 =20
 AB1890, as noted in the attatched Gart contract.  We have, however,=20
 instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify tha=
 t=20
 under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than 3/2002.  I=
 =20
 have not received a version of that contract.

 I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book=
 =20
 in California.  Correct me if I am wrong, but if the end of the transition=
 =20
 period ends earlier than priced, then our mark for this deal should increas=
 e=20
 because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a=20
 shorter period than expected.  Conversely, if the rate freeze ends later th=
 an=20
 how we priced it, then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will=
 =20
 have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than =
 we=20
 had priced.  This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil=
 e=20
 of our California portfolio.
 
 My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is=20
 defined.  It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose=
 =20
 ends.  Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of=
 =20
 the transition period, which is a critical date because the delivery risks=
 =20
 hinge on that definition.  I just want to do some preventative maintenance,=
 =20
 such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future. =
 =20
 However, we may proceed signing this contract if necessary.  I would just=
 =20
 like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this=
 =20
 deal.  As a matter of fact, I would not even try to change the contract=20
 language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern.
 
 I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now.

 Roger, I think Valerie tried to fax this to you.  Here's an electronic copy=

 Take a look, if you have any questions, please call me.
