 proceeds.  The roughly $975K is correct.  Thanks.  Any ideas on the cash?  I 
 was thinking about $800k in munis and $800k in S&P 500 index fund.  Your 
 thoughts.
 
 
 
 


  
  
 
 We received the two deposits you expected this week. The amount of the
 larger one was not the number you gave me. Take a look at client serve and
 see if it is correct.
