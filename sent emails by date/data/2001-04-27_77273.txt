 I spoke to Tia O'Neill of the Pompano Pelican.  She received the same 
 information (as the Sun Sentinel received) from some nameless person 
 regarding the payment in lieu of taxes issue and some sort of statement that 
 this was a roundabout way for Enron to bribe our way to victory.  I explained 
 to her as I had the Sun Sentinel all of the issues surrounding this topic.  
 However, she went further with questions regarding possible amounts of $1 
 million (for property taxes) or even $2 million to cover "some sort of sales 
 tax."
 
 It is quite evident someone close to the discussions is feeding the media.  
 Any thoughts?
 
 I am unable to gather any more information from David Fleshler (Sun 
 Sentinel).  Interestingly though, the Sun Sentinel has not run the article on 
 this issue.  My guess is they have realized that there is no story here.
