Unfortunately, it was clear that the only means by which I could give my career a fighting chance was to look outside of Enron.
  
 The good news is that I did find an opportunity. I have been promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Specialist. The bad news is that the company is not Enron. I really don't like the idea of leaving Enron, but I feel like I was left without a choice. What concerns me the most is that Enron's greatest asset has always been its people. If this is really true, then it's a huge shame your are rapidly losing the most important resource you have.
  
 As I mentioned earlier, I am writing you because I truly feel you care about Enron's continued growth and success. I think you need to know what is happening in the organization, and the sort of impact it has on your personnel.
  
 Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
