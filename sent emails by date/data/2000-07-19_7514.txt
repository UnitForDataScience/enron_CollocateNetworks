 Peggy,
 
 As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who 
 was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other 
 Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
 by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to 
 discuss.
 
 Thanks,
 Joe

 Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial 
 confirms.  For the referenced confirm, the status is currently showing 'Sent 
 to Counterparty", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
 revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
 was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I 
 can be contacted at ext. 6753.
 Thanks
 Peggy
