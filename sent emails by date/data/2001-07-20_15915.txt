 Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at 
 a minimum.
 In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it 
 still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will 
 keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
 The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to 
 amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
 The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is 
 growing.
 
 
 In the Senate:
 SB18XXAB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX)
 The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue.
 The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his 
 own bill (82XX).
 Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat 
 (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly 
 Republicans.
 In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail.
 Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very 
 difficult time getting a budget passed.
 As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is 
 trying to cobble together an alternative to 18.
