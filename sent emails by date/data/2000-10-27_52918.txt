 Stinson and Alex,
 
 Curt Randall wants to visit us at our lunch meeting next Friday (Nov. 3).   
 He is going to
 do a presentation to demo the software from his company SciFinance. 
 
 His visit is subject to change, that is why I want to wait till next week to 
 make the announcement.
 
 I appreciate that Stinson agrees to give a talk in the brown bag options 
 seminar.  We could move Stinson's talk
 to Thursday group meeting if Stinson OK it. Or we can reschedule Stinson's 
 talk to the following Friday.   
 
 Let me know your thoughts.
 
 Zimin
