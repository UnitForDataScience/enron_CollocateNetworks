 Daren,
 
 The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
 2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
 the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
 thru the 31st to the 215?
 
 I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.
 
 Thanks
 -Jackie-
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 


  
 Hey Anita,
 For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
 41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
 been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.
 
 Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
