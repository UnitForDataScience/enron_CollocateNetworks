 regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term 
 Capital Management debacle of last year.  These same issues may not apply in 
 the UK.

 Hi guys,
 
 I hope you can help me.  Are there any issues with us trading with Hedge 
 funds on EnronOnline?  Galtere have applied and seem to be one.
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 Regards
