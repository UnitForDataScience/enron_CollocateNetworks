 Hello James, 
 
 
 Near the end of July Oscar Ballesteros asked me to sent the Annual Accounts for TEE for signature to Adam Umanoff, because Herbert Peels was on vacation. 
 
 After Adam?s signature, he sent the documents to you directly. Do you have the documents yet? 
 
 If you have the documents, please could you sign them and send them  to Herbert Peels as soon as possible. 
 
 Thank you for your help in advance 
 
 
 Best regards 
 
 Veronika Zimmermann
