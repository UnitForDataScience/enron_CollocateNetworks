 Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
 two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
 Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
 involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
 your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
 business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.
 
 Best Regards,
 Athena
