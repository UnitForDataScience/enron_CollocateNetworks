 The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue 
 be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.
 
 Thanks,

 With this new book, you want the option to go to NG-PR-OPT (it is going to 
 NG-PRICE now) and the underlying swap to be between NG-PRICE and NG-PR-OPT?
 
 Please confirm!

 Dawne,
 
 Starting tommorrow, Mike's options need to be booked to NG-PR-OPT.  The deals 
 that are done online today will be manually switched to the new book by us.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol McLaughlin
