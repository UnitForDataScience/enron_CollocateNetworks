   Stock into a Hit"
 
 Drew, 
 
 This was in today's WSJ, but I don't see anything prior to that that isn't a 
 month old or more on the Blockbuster deal.  There was an announcement on the 
 wires on September 6 dealing with the n-Cube technology that will be used in 
 the Blockbuster deal.  Let me know if this is it!

  not 
 2001, as Blockbuster predicts. But Mr. Antioco says agreements with the 
 regional phone companies that provide DSL will bear fruit sooner and that the 
 company will soon announce other partners such as a maker of the set-top 
 boxes needed to order movies. 
 
 Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare argues that now is the time to buy because 
 Blockbuster's stock could move fast once investors grasp the possibilities of 
 the company's plan for multimedia distribution. 
 
 Both Mr. O'Hare and Salomon Smith Barney's Mr. Riedel classify Blockbuster as 
 particularly risky but say the company's outside-the-store initiatives should 
 serve as a catalyst for the stock over the next 18 or so months. 
 
 Mr. O'Hare says that time frame may not be compatible with investors' "notion 
 of instant gratification." But, he says, "it's worth it 
 in this case."
