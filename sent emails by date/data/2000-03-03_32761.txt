 at St 85 and delivered 145 to PSNC.

 Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day on
 Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris
 Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC 
 called
 me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC to
 contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth 
 on
 the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this.
 This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
 1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler and
 she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
 (impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth per
 day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
 and did get scheduled?  Thank you.
