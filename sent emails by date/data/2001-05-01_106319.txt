 Apologies for the delay.  The changes in your previous email are fine.  If
 there are no further issues, I will arrange for execution copies.

 Marcelo:
 
 When we last spoke on April 3, you told me that the blacklined agreement
 would be sent in the next few days.  Can you please provide me with an
 update?  I would like to finalize/execute before May 2 when I will be on
 vacation.
 
 Please advise.  Thank you.
