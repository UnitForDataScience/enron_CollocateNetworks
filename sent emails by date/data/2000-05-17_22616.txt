 technology effort really should be lead by NetWorks.  This is consistent wi=
 th=20
 Skillings strategy and what has been communicated to the analysts.  You=20
 should receive a call from one of these gentlemen.

 Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now=

 the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.
 
 ? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
 ? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
 ? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
 ? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
 ? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
 ? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
 ? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant=20
 circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

 I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These=

 commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would=

 like the opportunity to create this group.
