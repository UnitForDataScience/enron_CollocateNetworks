 I raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits (which we have done pursuant 
 to discussions we had last Friday)  My point on the fuel plan  was that 
 Reagan deleted it, which was fine with me.  There is language in the contract 
 addressing Enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities.

 Kay  Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
 obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
 fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?
