 California Gov. Gray Davis' advisers will speak to 
 Wall Street analysts Thursday following a live state address on the state's 
 energy crisis, according to an email sent to the financial community and 
 obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. 
 
 Daivs' staff, in a highly unusual move, asked radio and television 
 broadcasters to clear five minutes of air time Thursday night so Davis can 
 make an "important announcement" about the state's months-long energy crisis. 
 
 Sources close to the governor said Davis will discuss the state's 
 conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt supply shortfall expected this summer, 
 recent rate increases ordered by state regulators and the possibility for 
 further rate increases to replenish the state's budget surplus. 
 
 Davis is expected to discuss plans for keeping the state's three 
 investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & 
 Electric, Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California 
 Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, 
 solvent but he isn't expected to discuss a proposal to buy the utilities' 
 power lines. 
 
 Davis spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said he couldn't comment on the governor's 
 speech. He said, however, Davis has received the financial data regarding the 
 state's spending on wholesale electricity and what it expects to spend in the 
 months ahead. 
 
 In the email sent to Wall Street analysts, Davis' top financial adviser, Joe 
 Fichera, said the governor's advisers will hold a conference call at 9:45 
 p.m. EDT (0145 GMT) with analysts followed by a question-and-answer session. 
 
 Regarding Davis' speech Thursday, Fichera wrote in his email that "while 
 everyone will wish to speculate on what (Davis) will or will not say, I can 
 point out that the governor has been consistent in his goals to achieve: 
 significant demand side management, increased generation supply and 
 restoration of the financial health of the investor-owned utilities. 
 
 "All three components are important elements to resolving the energy 
 situation in California and will be addressed by the governor," Fichera wrote 
 in the email. 
 
 In addition, "it may go without saying, but the situation in California 
 involves many moving parts, many constituencies and independent players that 
 need to be brought together to resolve a problem that is of a size and scope 
 that no one anticipated," Fichera's email says. 
 
 "It certainly appears confusing and chaotic. The governor and his team 
 recognize the complexity of the problem and are rigorously attempting to move 
 the process to closure," the email says. "He is addressing all open issues so 
 that consumers, investors and others can achieve some certainty and move on. 
 We cannot make all the moving parts stop, nevertheless, the governor will 
 provide the leadership needed for a resolution."
