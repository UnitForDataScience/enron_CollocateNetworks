 Ok, seriously.  Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.  John, it 
 is hard to believe that  you could have acutually have married UP.  Good for 
 you.  Please thank  Debbie for a perfect night.  
 
 John, more details on the platimum AMEX with President's Club membership.  
 For real?
 
 I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.  I don't expect a problem, and 
 am ready for it if it surfaces.  No big deal.

 Hi.
 
 There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something 
 close.  I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.  Could 
 you email it to me?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
