  I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it 
 will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had 
 volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they 
 wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area.  
  My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take 
 volumes if they were nominated before 9:00.  Is that correct?  Please call me 
 so that we can discuss.
