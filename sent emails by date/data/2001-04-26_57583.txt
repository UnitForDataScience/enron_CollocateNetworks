  Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
 FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
 account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
 PG&E bankruptcy filing.  
 
 No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
 California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
 the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
 keep you posted.
