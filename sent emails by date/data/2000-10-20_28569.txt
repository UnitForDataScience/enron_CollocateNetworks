 to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem 
 (i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement).  
 If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a 
 responseI don't think it matters) and 
 express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF
