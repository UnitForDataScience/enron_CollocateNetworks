 The phone number for Ken Lay is (713) 853-6773.
 My recommendation is to call Mark Palmer first and discuss the book
 with him. His recommendation will open the door. I shall mention this to him
 as well. Mark's phone number is   (713) 853-4738.

 Vince,
 
 one of my colleagues here at Baylor is writing a book about "the business
 of heaven" in which he interviews prominent business leaders.  Bob Darden
 is his name and he's a former journalist and nice guy.  He would like to
 contact Ken Lay about being one of his interviews.  Do you think this is
 possible?  If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that Bob might
 use to contact Ken's secretary about setting up an interview?
 
 If this is in any way "not ok" please just say so.
 
 See ya,
 
 John
