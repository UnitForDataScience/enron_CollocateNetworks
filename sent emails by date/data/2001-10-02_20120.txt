 The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
 Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointeeargue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
 The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
 All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
 Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
 Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.
 
 Update on Edison Bailout
 Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.
 
 If you have any questions, just let us know.
