 i.e. what attachments are included with these LM 6000's.    
 
 Kay, what do you need to help with this.   Is it a full equipment list, or 
 some other equipment summary.    Could you please describe.   I believe 
 Marcelo or John Ayres are the most likely to be able to provide the 
 information, but am not quite sure what to ask for.      Thanks.
