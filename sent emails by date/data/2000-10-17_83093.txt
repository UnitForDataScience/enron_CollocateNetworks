 The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
 uncertain. A
 line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
 =20
 200-300
 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
 n=20
 the
 pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
 quantities of
 gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
 s=20
 precisely
 the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
 is=20
 on par
 with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
 =20
 2000,
 approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
 shallow trend
 does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
 to=20
 produce
 a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
 y=20
 build is
 expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
 =20
 growth of
 350 MMcf per day in 2001.
 
 Demand Slow but Exports Up
 TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
 October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
 =20
 accelerated;
 eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
 nd of=20
 October.
 Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
 ed
 storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
 levels.
 PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
 below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
 er
 Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
 d=20
 to be
 slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
 ed
 western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
 =20
 Canadian
 demand.
 
 High Prices, Wide Differentials
 The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
 US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
 October.
 For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=
 ng=20
 AECO
 average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).
