 I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay=
 's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that yo=
 u outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest=
  you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  =
 I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm=
  your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment =
 if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the=
  balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will re=
 spond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene o=
 n your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it look=
 s like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.
