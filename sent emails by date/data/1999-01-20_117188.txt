
 
 enough time for a bit of
 an earnings run.
 
 PRIA $35.50 +1.00 (+1.00) Up a full dollar is a decent rise
 on a $35 stock.  In fact, this stock was only down one of
 the last 5 trading days, and that was on a down market day.
 PRIA has been steadily climbing since its early December
 correction and it looks like it intends to keep going. The
 same factors helping the semi-conductor industry will help
 drive up this stock: increasing demand for computers and
 other equipment that use chips, and a decrease in the
 formerly overabundant supply of chips.
 
 LXK $102.38 +4.31 (+4.31) LXK had a stellar day today with its
 rise of 4%. This seems to be a pre-earnings run. We have
 noted in past commentaries that LXK has had earnings runs of
 an average of $6.00 over the last four quarters. It seems that
 this quarter will be no different. There is added expectation
 that LXK will announce a split. We have the earnings date as
 January 25th. If we hear different we will update you. LXK had
 an interesting article written about it's trials in selling
 printers to China. The problem wasn't the printers themselves,
 but the paper they were printed on. The paper was so difficult
 that LXK sent reams of paper to their researchers and told them
 to develop a printer that would print on the ancient paper. Shows
 the extent at which companies are willing to go in this world
 economy.
 
 ATI $92.63 +9.25 (+9.25) ATI did as expected and gapped open
 on Tuesday. The open was $95.75, over $3 above the close of
 the day. ATI and VOD have stated the deal needs to be completed
 by December 31st, 1999. The deal states that ATI shareholders
 will get 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. This will cause the
 value of the deal to change as time goes by. ATI is obviously
 trading well below the true value of the deal, but this is
 common until the deal is finalized.  If you want to play
 the rest of this deal (since currently ATI should be worth
 $101.25 based on VOD's close today):
 
 *We suggest waiting for the next dip.
 BUY CALL FEB-85 ATI-BQ OI= 6868 at $10.00 SL=7.50 ITM $7.63
 BUY CALL FEB-90 ATI-BR OI=10024 at $ 6.88 SL=5.25
 BUY CALL APR-90 ATI-DR OI=  658 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75
 
 LU $114.06 +3.81 (+3.81) LU had a pretty good day on Tuesday
 and closed just $.75 off its highs for the day.  We are now
 just $6 from LU's 52-week high.  We have verified LU's earnings
 date.  Earnings will be announced before the market opens on
 the 21st of January (this Thursday). We are seeing a nice
 earnings run which should continue until the earnings release.
 Watch for pullbacks to initiate new plays. There are always
 times to purchase, just be patient and buy the dips.
 
 XIRC $42.00 +2.13 (+2.13) XIRC shot up today on the expectations
 of it's earnings announced after the close today. We had the
 earnings date as January 21st, so we apologize for the mis-
 information.  For those of you that are holding XIRC, the
 earnings came in at $.39 a share.  This is $.04 more than
 estimates and a penny ahead of the whisper. If anyone is
 thinking of buying into XIRC, wait for a pullback after the
 gap open.  XIRC's earnings were $.11 same quarter last year.
 XIRC unveiled high-speed ISDN data support for its Global-
 Access RealPort Ethernet+Modem and modem-only integrated
 PC cards. This technology connects notebook PCs at 128Kbps.
 
 COF $131.50 +1.06 (+1.06) COF announced earnings today and
 they came in right on estimates of $1.04. This originally
 pushed shares of COF down slightly. As the day played on,
 COF traded up and ended up at its high of the day. The whisper
 number was the same as the estimate. COF is sitting right
 around its 52-week high. If the market continues to trend up
 then COF should be a leader. Their earnings rose from $.86 a
 share in the same quarter last year.  We were a little bit
 disappointed that they did not announce a split.  We are
 guessing that COF's management does not have a split clause
 in their compensation.  They receive some pretty big bonuses
 if they can get COF's share price to $175 within the next
 2 1/2 years.
 
 CHKPF $55.50 +4.25(+4.25) CHKPF took off today and closed just
 1/2 a point off its intraday highs. CHKPF blew by its prior 52-
 week high on strong volume. CHKPF's earnings are on the 21st,
 and we are seeing the effects of an earnings run. CHKPF has
 historically blown away earnings estimates. CHKPF's last five
 earnings surprises have gone like this: 13,22,28,23,78. These
 are percentage surprises. Numbers like these cause an earnings
 run. Though a split isn't eminent, they do have shares to do
 a split.
 
 ETH $49.56 +.63 (+.63) ETH traded in a range of $49.13 to $50.75.
 Not a bad day considering that ETH is not in the technology
 arena.  ETH announced earnings on the 13th of January and beat
 estimates by $.02.  The general feeling out there is that
 furniture stores had a great holiday season.  ETH is still $17
 away from its 52-week high.  This leaves a lot of room to go.
 
 YHOO $323.00 +6.00 (+6.00) YHOO had an interesting day.  YHOO
 opened at $340, which was a premium of $23 above Friday's close.
 YHOO traded as high as $345 and as low as $318.  YHOO got it's

 speculation that other consolidation is in the works.  YHOO has
 had a strong correction over the last week and this could be
 the start of a new Internet frenzy. This remains a risky play.
 Wait for upward confirmation.  YHOO continues to be a blue-chip
 of the Internet.  The price of Exodus Communications rose 34%
 from the mention that it is in a deal with YHOO. Remember, YHOO
 has a split coming up at the end of the month (about 3 weeks).
