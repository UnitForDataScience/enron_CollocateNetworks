 get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the 
 house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!  I 
 will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from 
 work.  I don't think they know
 exactly what to do...Cara and I have suggested a nutritionist but, you know,
 Mother knows nutrition so I guess that is not needed....
 
 I don't think Dad looks very good but I don't think he has for a while....
