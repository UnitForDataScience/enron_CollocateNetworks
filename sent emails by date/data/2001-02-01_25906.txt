 Ed,
 
 Sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal I have attached below.  
 Apparently we bot from PGE Industrial on the 12th and 13th.  PG&E has 
 allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to TECO, and claim that they are 
 net deals.  I do not show a sale in the system at the meter, and I checked 
 the 215 K for those days for a corresponding delivery to TECO, perhaps at 
 another meter, and could not find one.  
 
 Any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated.
