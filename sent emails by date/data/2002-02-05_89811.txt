 Thanks.
 
 
 

 
     
     
     
    Kevin,
 
    It looks like Tuesday morning will work best for Erik.  I am supposed to
 
    meet with him at 9:00 am Tuesday morning, but
 
    am flexible if that time works for you.  Just let me know what time is
 
    ideal and I will schedule it with Erik.
