 Dear Mr. Malcolm
 
 I hope you could remember me.  I visited you with my colleague in November
 1999 to discuss possible collaboration between Enron and Mitsui.  While we
 could not identify any project which we can jointly proceed with, the
 discussion we had with you at that time was very useful for us.
 
 The reason for me to writing this now is that I heard from some people that
 Enron is now considering sale of Enron's wind power assets (Enron Wind).
 We
 think that the Wind power will be more popular in Japan as well and we have
 an interest in Enron Wind.  If you have any idea about status of Enron's
 this effort, it would be very helpful if you could share some idea with me,
 like price level Enron is thinking of and whether or not any actual
 negotiation is going on, etc.
 
 I will be travelling most of next two weeks and it would be very convenient
 if you could e-mail me your response.
 
 Regards,
 Ichiro Tamura, Mitsui USA
