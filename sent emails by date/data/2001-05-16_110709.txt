Depending on when I go up to the 1000 islands, I'll probably come back from the 1000 islands on Sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking.  Would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for Sunday?  Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back.  Jeff will be around in case you didn't know.  Anyway, I'll be in touch.
