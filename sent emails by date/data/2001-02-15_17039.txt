 Steve asked that I forward this to you.  I believe that Steve left you a=20
 voicemail describing the nature of the email.
 
 All the best,

 Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
 To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
 =20
 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
 =20
 than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.
 
 The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
 slation=20
 are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
 se=20
 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
 =20
 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
 =20
 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
 transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
 ir=20
 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
 required reductions in pollution emissions.
 
 Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
 Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
 =20
 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
 =20
 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
 st=20
 effectively and quickly in two ways:
 
 Buy-down demand
 California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
 d=20
 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
  more=20
 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
 ld=20
 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
 =20
 through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
 reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
 eal=20
 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.
 
 Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
 To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:
 
 An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
 =20
 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
 =20
 verification.
 Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
 =20
 paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).
 
 The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
 e:
 
 =01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
 cularly=20
 in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
 =20
 resources.
 reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
 electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
 in=20
 the state.
 fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
 k=20
 of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
 customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
 =20
 responding.=20
 
 We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
 =20
 excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
 =20
 summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
 =20
 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
 s=20
 that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.
 
 Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
 cle:=20
 SB27X
 The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
 re=20
 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
 =20
 service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
 =20
 customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
 e=20
 prohibition against Direct Access.
 
 Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
 =20
 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
 f=20
 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
 =20
 customer migration. =20
 
 In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
 =20
 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
 nt=20
 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
 function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
 non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
 ia=20
 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
 in=20
 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
 =20
 of utility load.
 
 Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
 vehicle:=20
 AB18X
 Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
 . =20
 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
 imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
 =20
 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
 ia=20
 State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
 ed=20
 period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
 e=20
 in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
 participate in that market.
 
 California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
 =20
 series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
 increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=
 =20
 =01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=
 ould=20
 amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=
 d. =20
 In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=
 =20
 First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20
 recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =
 AB=20
 1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=
 eceived=20
 from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=
 e=20
 accrued due to the retail price cap.
