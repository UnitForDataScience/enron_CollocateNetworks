 could be one of our faces.  I found out last week that I didn't get drawn
 for the deer/hog hunt that I have gone on the last two years.  Are you going
 to take Ryan hunting?  If so when and where.  Right now Daniel is tied up
 with being football manager and we don't get to do much.  Thanks for the air
 force song that you sent, I got a big kick out of it.  I have been going to
 a seminar call "Making your children mind without loosing yours" by a man
 named Kevin Leman.  It has been really good and is Biblically based.  He has
 a book out by the same name that I would highly recommend.
 
 Later,
 Randy
