 the Acura sites.  Vehicle looks pretty sweet.

 Gerald,
 
 I booked the reservation below through my Frito-Lay travel agency.  I think I
 can probably book you another room at the same rate if you'd like.  This is 
 for
 the Marriott Capital for $129 a night.  The Sheraton rooms would have been 
 $125
 but they were sold out.  The Marriott is actually closer to the reception (2
 blocks) than the Sheraton, so we'll be able to walk over.
 
 Let me know and I'll try to get another room.
 
 Ern
