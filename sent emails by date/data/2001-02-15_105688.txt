 Stewart,
 
 PRM has 4 utility clients (Benton PUD, Franklin PUD, Grays Harbor PUD and
 City of Richland) that will be purchasing BPA's Slice product beginning
 October 1, 2001.  I want to get the process started to get ISDA's in place
 between Enron and these utilities.  We are currently in the beginning stages
 of discussing financial trades with their legal counsel.  Fortunately for
 Enron, I think we can have one attorney represent all 4 of PRM's clients.
 (FYI, that attorney will be Doug Rosenberg at Preston Gates & Ellis in
 Seattle.)
 
 To get started, I'd like Enron to forward to me copies of the ISDA agreement
 that you would propose as the starting point for discussions.  I also ask
 that you send me a list/examples of any other documentation Enron will
 require (e.g., legal opinion, board resolution, etc.).  Please send just one
 set of documentation at this point.  I want to get the basic legal review
 process underway before you prepare four different sets of documents.  I'd
 also like to request that when we get to the point of having Enron's
 attorney walk through the ISDA with our attorney, that Enron use Sara
 Shackleton.  Sara was great to work with when we went through this for
 Merced, and I think she'd be extremely helpful once again as we venture into
 new territory with these 4 utilities.
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Jeff
