
 
 Lisa,
 
 I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy =
 an=20
 existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new onlin=
 e=20
 product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because=20
 counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if=
 =20
 their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  Wh=
 at=20
 I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any=
 =20
 counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterpartie=
 s=20
 up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm th=
 is.
 
 Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile,=20
 because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issu=
 es=20
 specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just =
 in=20
 case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...
 
 I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.

 We plan on putting two new Physical Steel product types into Production=20
 sometime next week. Jason Althaus already has the GT&Cs and will prepare th=
 em=20
 for upload when the product types are available.
 Included are final versions of the two short and long product descriptions.=
 =20
 Also included are spreadsheets detailing the location and quality=20
 combinations that will initially be shown on the Website.
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 Carl
