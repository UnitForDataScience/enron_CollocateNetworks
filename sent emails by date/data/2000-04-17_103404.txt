 closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party 
 to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS
 European Power Holdings.  Is the attached form 
 of confirmation acceptable to that counterparty?  Also, is Maroon Aboudy the 
 appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?  
 Thank you.
