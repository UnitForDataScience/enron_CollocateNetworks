 Shirley (3-5290) is making travel arrangements for me.
 
 
 It makes sense for all of us to stay in the same hotel,

 Robert,
 
 This is to confirm the meeting on March the 20th at 9:00 a.m. Enron will be
 represented by
 Bill Bradford, Bryan Seyfried,,Vasant Shanbhogue and myself.
 
 Could you, please, advise me what is the best hotel where we could stay
