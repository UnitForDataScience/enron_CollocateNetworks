 Mark:
 
 Last week you requested that I give you a list of about 10 counterparties
 that
 you would forward on to ISDA.  Please note that the listed counterparties
 came
 from information given to me by the documentation group.  In any event, the
 list
 is as follows:
 
           1.  AEP
           2.  Aquila
           3.  Coral
           4.  Duke Energy Trading
           5.  El Paso Merchant Energy
           6.  Koch
           7.  PG&E Energy Trading
           8.  Reliant
           9.  Southern Company Energy Marketing
           10. Williams Energy
 
 I hope this is of some help.
 
 Jeff
