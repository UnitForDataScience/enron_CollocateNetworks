 Cynthia,
 
 Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested 
 in
 following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like
 to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on
 how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should
 be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as
 operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican
 on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on
 legislation.
 
 Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on
 this.
 
 - Joshua
