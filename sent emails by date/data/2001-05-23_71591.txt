 that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
 which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
 is one thought.  What do you think?

 One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
 executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
 third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
 applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
 we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
 requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
 on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
 whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
 from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

 Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
 I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
 Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
 Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
 necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.
 

 

 
 If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
 good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
 you.
 
 Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
 the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
 the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.
