 Mark,
 
 Attached are a presentation on the Financial Stress Score and the countries
 that have risk scores available today. Please let me know if you have any
 questions.
 
 In response Vince's question regarding false positives from the model, that
 is a little difficult to answer.  The model is predicting the likelihood of
 a company experiencing financial distress.  We are not saying that all
 companies with a high risk score will experience financial distress.  In
 other words, it is not really a yes or no proposition.  It' not like a drug
 test where the test either comes back positive or negative and ocassionally,
 you get a false positive test result.  We are identifying companies that are
 at high risk for failure.  Some of those high risk companies will fail and
 some will not fail.  How many in each classification that will ultimately
 fail is addressed in the performance charts attached below.
 
 Please let me know if you have any other questions or need any additional
 information.
