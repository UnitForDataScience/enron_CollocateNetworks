 Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports 
     
 Robin called because Christopoulos Diomedes (I didn't look up the spelling) has been calling John Novak, Pete Weidler, and Joe [Kischkill?] "asking where the review of payment" stands.  Diomedes believes "he met the milestones."   Robin was told that you and Mary Joyce were working on this.
 
 Can you e-mail Robin Treadwell and give her an update?  Thanks.
