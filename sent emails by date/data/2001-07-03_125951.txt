       Just a note as I had spoken to each of you over the course of the
       last year on our Oatt. I have attached copies of our news release
       from yesterdays announcements. Our web site should be populated later
       today and have many of the documents and  a time line on the opening
       of our system.
 
       If you have questions please call me at 306 566 3794, or Ted Quade at
       306 566 3075
