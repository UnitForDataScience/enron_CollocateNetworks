  change from taping everything to taping only 
 the deal terms at the end of a call
 
 The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
 require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
 traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
 terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.
