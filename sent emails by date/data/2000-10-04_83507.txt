 properly.
  Bring ref #'s  10170 & 10055.    ENA does reflect 
 these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate 
 these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two 
 termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal 
 contracts that were done in Apirl & May 00  between Roger and myself, Sitara 
 deals 242653 & 271301; Algasco  would like to tie these contracts  to the 
 newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with.
 
 All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare 
 # 250196, which I mentioned above.  I do not know the demand fees associated 
 with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or 
 if they are being billed accurately.
 
 Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the 
 confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.    Please get with 
 me once you have a minute.    Thank you.
