 After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as 
 too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an 
 effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state 
 legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that 
 serves at the request of the California Governor.
 
 QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from 
 one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California 
 Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger western 
 regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs are 
 reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?
 
 ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.  
 However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power crunch 
 comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during times of 
 real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to shoot first 
 and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions involving 
 out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial interests 
 sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of robust, 
 competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions practically 
 guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.
