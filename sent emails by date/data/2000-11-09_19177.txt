 Mondavi's always a classic, and up the hill is La Famiglia (Mondavi brand 
 that's a sweet view, great place to have a picnic lunch, and it has some neat 
 brique-braque.
 Hess collection.
 Sterling.
 Jarvismaybe one of the best wines, dare I say, anywhere).  
 Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus, and I'll get on it pronto.  And 
 if you want to do Jarvis, call now!
 
 
 Hess Collection.  Opus.  Sterling.  Mondavi.  Jarvis (if you can get in).
