 Who should Clay and  V V be working with to get started on the Malaysia/Enron 
 web page?
 Online liquefied natural gas trading is on the 
 way and will challenge the way business in the industry is done, 
 Mohammed Damit, head of LNG marketing for Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd, said this week 
 at a gathering of gas industry executives. 
 
 "It's only a matter of time before we see energy trading activities on the 
 net," Damit said, adding that the biggest LNG online opportunities are
 in ship chartering and spot LNG trading. 
 
 Damit said online trading would result in greater price volatility. 
 
 LNG prices are currently indexed to crude oil prices, in term contracts for 
 as long as 20-30 years, that tend to smooth out price fluctuations 
 over the life of the contract. 
 
 Damit added that online traders will use standardized documents, simplifying 
 trading.
