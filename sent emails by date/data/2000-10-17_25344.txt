 The buyer's name on deal440093 is Koch Midstream shouldn't it be Duke Energy 
 Field Services?

 I have created two new deals in Sitara.  You will need to get with someone in 
 Volume Management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals 
 for Jan-Sep.  The Logistics group will be able to adjust October forward.  
 
 Deal #s:

 Tina,
 
 With regards ti the Koch Midstream, you could talk to Daren Farmer about it. 
 Also, Carlos Rodriguez could help.
