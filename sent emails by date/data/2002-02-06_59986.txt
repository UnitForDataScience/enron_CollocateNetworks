 Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

 I left the cover sheet in your chair with the changes that need to be made.  Can you please make those changes?  Thanks.
