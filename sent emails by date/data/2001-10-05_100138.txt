 Today I was running at a fast pace with TW, NNG, systems.
 Again thank you.

 Darrell, we did not receive the gas day map this morning via fax.
 
 Would you please make the necessary arrangements to have this document faxed to Steve every morning.  It is essential that we receive this on a regular basis.
 
 Thanks in advance for your assistance,
