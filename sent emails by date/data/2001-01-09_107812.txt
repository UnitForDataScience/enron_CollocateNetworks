 Here is the latest version of the presentation to banks.  I have incorporated 
 the comments I have received so far (although I have deleted a bit on the 
 shipping slide on the EGM portion because it was duplicative).  Because this 
 needs to be printed/bound by early tomorrow morning, I would ask that all 
 changes to this presentation be given to me by no later than 3:30 london 
 time.  
 
 The final presentation will have background graphics but i have removed them 
 for now to enable easier emailing.
 
 Thank you.
