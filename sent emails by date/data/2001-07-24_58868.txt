
 
 Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.
 
 Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk.
 
  
     
 Please pull information on the soft money federal contributions by the following organizations:
 
 Duke
 Dynegy
 Mirant
 Southern
 Williams
 
 Various financial institutions
 
 Eli Lilly and other pharmaceuticals
 
 We're interested in their overall spend, their party split, and the individual candidates they're contributing to.
 
 Thanks.
