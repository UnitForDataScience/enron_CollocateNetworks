 Hi Vince
 
 That's great - delighted you'll be participating. I've put you down as the
 chairman for stream 1, day 1 on 9 May 2000.
 
 By the way, is your job title still VP, Head of Research at Enron North
 America? I need to know for the brochure.
 
 If I don't speak to you before the new year, I wish you a very Merry Xmas
 and a Happy New Millennium!
 
 Emma
