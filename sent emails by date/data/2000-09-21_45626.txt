 they?
 
 Did you see on the news last night that they arrested 44 people for 
 participating in that pyramid scheme you were telling me about?  There's an 
 article about it in the KHOU TV website.

 Thanks for the info.  I sent in my resume with a letter that they requested
 explaining how my experience would fit the job, plus salary requirements.
 Once again, I will keep my fingers crossed.
 
 Do you want plant/plants??
