 Damnit Jeff.  What is the sleeping situation in the second cabin.  I don't
 have time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 The panic is my waste of time trying to get things organized.  That's the
 panic.  I also don't want to tell people there are beds for them if there
 are not.  Could you just right a simple straightforward email with the
 number of beds.  Was there a math error on that one also????

 (iffy times two), then they'll need a bed.  that work?
