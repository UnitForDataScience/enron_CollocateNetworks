  by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
 resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from
 my
 office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
 HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
 EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
 agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
 to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate
 individuals
 on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
 try to push this forward this week.
 
 Please let me know if you need any additional information from
 HoustonStreet.
 
 Best regards,
 Frank Getman
