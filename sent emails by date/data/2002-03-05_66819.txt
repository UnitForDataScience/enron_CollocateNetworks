 I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
 TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.
 
 Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
 surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.
 
 Thanks!
