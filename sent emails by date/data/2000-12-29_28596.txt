 thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
 limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
 are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
 work as good.  
 
 3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
 could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
 event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.
 
 I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF
