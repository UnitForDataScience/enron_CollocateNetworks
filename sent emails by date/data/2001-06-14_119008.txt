  trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per =
 hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water go=
 t so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to=
  get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It=
  looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab si=
 nce some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the d=
 oor sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in bi=
 g trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I w=
 ould have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the seco=
 nd floor

 Nice photos - they're incredibly detailed.  Are you happy with the camera?
 I've thought about getting one but there are so many different
 brands/options/details/prices I can't figure out which one I would want!
 
 Here are a few from our recent trips, taken with a regular camera that we
 also got on a picture CD when they were developed:
