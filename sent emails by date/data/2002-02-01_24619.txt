 To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.
 Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
 The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr. Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while those further down believed the hype.
 "We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lost his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."
 He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec. 2.
 Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her family also lost its fortune.
 In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
 "Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale," she said. "We are fighting for liquidity."
