 Daren - did we have a purchase from Beaumont Methonal on 2/9?  I show a deal of 5.000 on deal 611178.  I confirmed a total of 13.000 (deal 603107) for that day.  Were we buying back 5.000 or was the deal reduced to 13000?

 OK thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, Joanie received a call from Beaumont stating that there is a sale to HPL on 2/9 for 5,000 mmbtu. This was reflected on the supply  draft and Buddy Majorrwitz looked into this before he/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to HPL from Beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/ all 02/01 prod. sales to HPL ? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to customer?
