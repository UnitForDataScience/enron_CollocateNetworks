 Presto got some info the Calpine got a great price on their power sale to California.  Are we negotiating with California and will they agree to credit terms that we like.  It seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the California.  If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.

 Gentlemen:
 
 I have spoken with CDWR several times since we submitted our proposal.  They are immediately interested in a 5 year power sale and then want to discuss Pastoria.  I updated a price for Freeman for 200MW Peak SP-15 5 Year ($124/MWh).  I also spoke with their lawyers a couple of times to start trading comments.  I volunteered to send a team to LA today or tomorrow, but so far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the primary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to support the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have priority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.  I expect to hear from them again later today.  I will keep you posted.
 
 Regards,
 
 Chris
