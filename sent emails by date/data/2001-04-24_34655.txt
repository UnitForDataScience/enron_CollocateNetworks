Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.
 
 I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck.
 
 
 
 
 
 


   
 
 What kind of kitty does Ingrid have??
 
 Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
 the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
 exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
 visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
 visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
 meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
 when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.
 
 
 
 

 
  
 
 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
 That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine
 is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!
 
 What's up with you girl?
