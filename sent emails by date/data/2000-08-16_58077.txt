 it for now.

 I believe we should back Massey as well.  Who do we weigh in with now?

 Joe,
 
 As you are probably aware, Jim Hoecker is considering leaving FERC
 relatively soon.  The President will then name a new Chairman.  Bill Massey
 is quite interested in receiving the nomination.
 
 Please call to discuss.
 
 John
