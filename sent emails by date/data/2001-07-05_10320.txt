 Ava can certainly help out where needed.  Thanks. Lynn

 I just wanted to let you know that I will need to leave today around 4:00.  At this time, I don't know the actual flight time for tomorrow,  but it could be as early as 3:30.  I will be on vacation Monday , Tuesday and possibly Wednesday.  I will send out a separate message to everyone once I have flight arrangements finalized.
 
 Sorry for being so evasive, but things are still in a state of turmoil for me.
 
 Thanks for understanding,
 Ricki
