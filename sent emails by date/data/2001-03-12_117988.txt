 Thanks for asking!

 FYI. I have not committed to doing this yet. You had previously mentioned 
 that you wanted to visit with Paul. If you have not already done so, this 
 might be a good time to do so. Are you open to a meeting?

 Dear Alan:
 
      I will be in Houston on March 20 and 21.  Would you have time for an 
 early
 dinner or late afternoon meeting on Tuesday the 20th?  Please let me know.
