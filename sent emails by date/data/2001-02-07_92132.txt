 I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those 
 days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of 
 the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 
 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once 
 Feb rolles to intramonth the "From date" on the calc is changed from the Jan 
 1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect 
 on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly 
 captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR 
 calc not the post ids.  
 
 Let me know if this doesn't answer your question.

 Wei,
 I appreciate your help. If I hear you right, it appears it may have to do 
 with the way post id's and books are officialized.  Thanks for your help.
 
 Robin,
 For whatever reason, we didn't pick up VaR for Feb intra-month on Jan 31, and 
 on Feb 1, a lot of intra month hit.  I've been investigating, with Bharat, 
 and RAC initially thought it had something to do with the code and that GRMS 
 didn't roll in physical until the first of the month (I guess).  Now it seems 
 like it may have something to do with the way Post id's/books are 
 officialized. (I guess).  Please give this a looksy and let me know.
 
 Nilay,
 Thanks for your help, any ideas on why would be helpful.
 
 Let me/Bharat know if we should bring ERMS into the picture.
 
 Thanks,
 Frank
 
 
 
    
 	
 	

 	
 


 
  
 Bharat,
 
 First I checked VaR number for this portfolio_id since 26-JAN-01.  Notice 
 there was consecutive VaR jump from 26-JAN-01 to 1-FEB-01.
 
 PORTFOLIO_ID    EFF_DT        DOWN95       UP95
 
    26-JAN-01          3          314034.299          0 (Reference date 
 30-JAN-01 to 31-JAN-01)
    29-JAN-01          3          4530604.63          0 (Reference date 
 31-JAN-01 to 28-FEB-01)
    30-JAN-01          3          8901557.37          0 (Reference date

    01-FEB-01          3          8782018.97          0 (Reference date

    02-FEB-01          3          7889069.32          0 (Reference date

 It looks to me the trend on VaR change is very similar to the trend on delta 
 position change.  If you want to know why delta position went higher from 
 26-JAN-01 to 01-FEB-01, we need to get ERMS people involved.  RisktRAC 
 basically just pulls position from ERMS.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Wei
