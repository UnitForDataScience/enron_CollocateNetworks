Given the shape of the loan, Enron will have to post significant collateral on the 03 & 04 positions, and I need a PV cost associated with collateral requirements of this loan package.  Please talk with Bradford with respect to credit $'s.
 
  
     
 Duke has indicated that the cannot complete the proposed commodity/loan transaction with my proposed collateral threshold exemption.   They have indicated that creates "accounting issues" for there accrual book.
 
 Therefore, I need to know the cost of credit to assign to the proposed cash flows.  In rough numbers, we receive $200 million in the first two years and return $250 million in the last two years.
 
 Because of this, in years 03 and 04, our collateral posting will be significant.
 
 Let me know your thoughts ASAP on Monday morning.
