 Please find attached redrafts of the swap confirm and swap schedule,
 with changes marked from the last drafts.
 
 Please note that Enron's obligations to pay principal under the swap
 should terminate in the event of a transfer to a third party under section
 5.05 of the sale and option agreement before the expiry of the option
 period. This is because the third party will not be obliged to swap the
 proceeds of sale it receives from PR-C in the event that the option is
 exercised. See section 3.3 of the schedule.
 
 Also, the definition of Payments Received may need to be changed once
 the flow of funds in the indenture and trust agreement have been
 finalized.
 
 Please call me on 214 659 4403 if you have any questions.
