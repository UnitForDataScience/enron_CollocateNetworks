 was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would 
 want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the 
 attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to 
 putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and 
 Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them?
