 I believe that I am still authorized to have access to the database.  I think 
 the problem is that I am on an EI server that is not connected to the ECT 
 server where the database resides.  Thanks.

 Joya - Please submit a security request for Brendt Hendry in Argentina to 
 have access to the NEW Master Swap Agreements database in Lotus Notes.
 
 Thanks,
