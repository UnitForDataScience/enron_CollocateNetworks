  I left this in my email inbox for some reason.  It is my recollection that 
 we talked about this and I asked you to have them make the changes they were 
 requesting to make to their form and send us a final executed document.  Is 
 that correct?

 We spoke about this grty last week. Please let me know if you are comfortable 
 and make the changes that you see fit. I will send it to the counterparty 
 when you are done.
