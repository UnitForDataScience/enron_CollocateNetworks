 The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for 
 control purposes.  ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or 
 Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate 
 workbook).  The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the 
 account.  We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly 
 whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing 
 the opening of brokerage accounts.  I think that Marie previously sent you a 
 form.  Let us know if you have any questions.  
 
 What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?

 I spoke with Ted Murphy regarding setting up the brokerage account for the 
 Copel shares.  He indicated that the easiest thing to do is coordiante with 
 Sara Shackelton (ECT finance lawyer).  Typically, she sets up the paperwork 
 and Ted (or Rick) signs off on setting up the account (she has done this many 
 times).  Robert may have already done this or it may not be necessary in this 
 case - I will leave that up to him.  Regardless, Ted (or Rick) does need to 
 be one of the people who sign the documents.  Sorry for the delay.
