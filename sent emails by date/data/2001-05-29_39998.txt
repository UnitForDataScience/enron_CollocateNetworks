 Mark:  As I am sure you agree, I thought that CA Attorney General Lockyer's 
 comment last week in the WSJ was one of the most outrageous I have ever seen 
 from a major public official.  I wanted to send a brief "Letter to the 
 Editor" of the WSJ to that effect.  However, in light of the sensitivity of 
 the entire CA situation in general and the further press last week in the New 
 York Times, I did not want to do that without confirming with you that doing 
 so would not be objectionable to the Company.  A copy of the proposed letter 
 is attached.  I would propose to submit this in my individual capacity, not 
 as counsel to the Company.  I'll wait to hear from you, or from Mark, Vicki 
 or Rick before doing anything.    Thanks.  John
