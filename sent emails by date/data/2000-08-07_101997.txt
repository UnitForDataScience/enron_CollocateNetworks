 for now since you're working so hard...but you're going to have to deliver at

  1. Question: If you could live forever, would you and why?
     Answer:  "I would not live forever, because we should not live forever, 
 because if we were supposed to live     forever, then we would live forever, 
 but we cannot live forever,  which is why I would not live
   forever."                   a parting word from
  Dan Quayle:
 
   14. "I love California.  I practically grew up in Phoenix."
