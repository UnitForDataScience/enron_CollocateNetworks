 Dear Jane McBride
 
 I got a call from Mitsui Marine that they want to forego ISDA contract.
 They and Enron credit have already had an ISDA agreement.
 According to this, the contact was done under the head office guarantee basis.
 (I don't know the detail)
 If the contract between Enron Japan and them will be made under the same term and condition
 It will be great help for both sides.
 Their interest for us is only trade of weather derivatives (they don't have a needs of any other commodities). 
 Could you show it them under the same term and condition?
 Again if it will be all right that this thing will go smooth and quick.
