    Today at the Commercial Practices Committee (SPP) we voted to accept the
    draft real time market design for the "Day 2" market (i.e. 12/15/02).
    This design, while not perfect, is in the direction of PJM.  As such it
    provides a real time market (yes you will be able to go long/short
    10,000MW in real time!), with no penalties and no balanced schedule
    requirement.  Although control areas will be maintained, SPP will be the
    central dispatcher (the role of the control areas as of 12/15/02 has yet
    to be determined).  Moreover, the SPP real time market will probably be
    implemented by MISO and is being looked at by GridSouth.  Overall this
    is a pretty good outcome for both Enron and the market in general.
 
    On a different note,  I provided Jim Steffes with my letter of
    resignation today.  I don't know whether or not I will be back in the
    office so I wanted to express what a pleasure it has been to work with
    (for?) you and the desk - I am very grateful for the confidence that you
    have shown in me.  My biggest regret is that the market design function
    didn't reside within your area of management rather than under
    government affairs.
 
    If I can ever be of any help please don't hesitate to contact me.
 
    Kind regards, Ron
