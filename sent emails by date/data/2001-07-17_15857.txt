 where CMA, the Chamber, CLECA and the generators are first.  You know where 
 they are?
 
 Best,

 She is there in her capacity as WGSI until you agree with me that Enron
 should oppose this bill.  Hint, hint.  Have you heard from Harry or Jim S.
 or Parquet?  Mike

 Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
 Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
 anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
 binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
 exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
 discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day
