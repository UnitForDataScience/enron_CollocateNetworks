 ll meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to "m=
 ass mail" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday after=
 noon or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vicke=
 rs and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and pow=
 er covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation i=
 n person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will like=
 ly come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presenta=
 tion could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sen=
 se to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the w=
 ord to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We =
 can start those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logi=
 stics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really t=
 hink that we need one.   =20
 
 Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to de=
 liver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from=
  Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him =
 on that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and=
  will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with=
  her that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as=
  the other "out of towner" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the nex=
 t time that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April=
  17, 18 or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with hi=
 m perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west=
  power risk team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetin=
 gs here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I ca=
 n discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentatio=
 ns at lunch tomorrow. =20
 
 I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage=
  and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  Sally =09

 Weren't we supposed to be having a meeting on costs of back office services=
  with the Heads of Origination?  Are we close to having this?
 
 Thanks
