 Resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible.  
 Yes, Tammy is still with us.  We marked our 10 year anniversary with her in 
 March, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in 
 Kentucky.  I truly am blessed.  
 
 I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you 
 were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
 control my enthusiasm over seeing you.
 
 I apologize if I disrupted you.

 P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from 
 UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing 
 very well and very much in love.
