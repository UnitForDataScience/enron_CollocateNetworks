 week, if possible.

 Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
 this.
 
 Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
 Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
 passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
 that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
 skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
 the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
 month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
 get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
 to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.
 
 In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
 will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
 these Position Values will be. 
 
 Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
 during bid week?

 We have finsihed creating and testing a the new 24x5 Nat Gas Product (a month 
 long transaction which only moves gas Mon-Fri). A final question has come up 
 - how will these be calculated. Jennifer is under the impression that 
 something was being built in the EOL Position Summary Report that would be 
 able to calculate these kinds of trades. Is that the case? Has that been done?
