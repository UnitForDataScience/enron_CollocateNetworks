 the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading 
 agreements.  Carol St. Clair is the lawyer working on this master (I'm a 
 paralegal).  Thanks.

 I believe this means only that we are not closing a deal today.  I would
 still like the contracts, please, in anticipation that we may yet do a deal.
