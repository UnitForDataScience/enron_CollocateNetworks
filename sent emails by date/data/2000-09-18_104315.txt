
 
 I have not heard back from our lawyers.
 Hopefully tomorrow.
 
 Also, I attach the broker dealer attachment 2 which you said you didn't
 have.
 
 I think we resolved most of your WPG questions.  WPG is OK with all of your
 changes except Insert 6.  I will try to get further resolution as to why
 they object so that you can negotiate further if you like.
 
 If all goes well, hopefully this can be wrapped up tomorrow.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mike
