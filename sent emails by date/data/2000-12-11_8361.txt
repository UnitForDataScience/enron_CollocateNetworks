 spreadsheets, which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.  Are their 
 positions not being captured and aggregated?  What does Scott Mills have to 
 say about this?

 Duong,
 Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need

 Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
 deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
 S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
 America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
 think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
 In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
 proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.
 
 Thanks for your help,
