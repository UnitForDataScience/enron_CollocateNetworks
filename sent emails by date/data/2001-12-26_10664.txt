 	contract that nominated at that point for the 21 through 31.  This automaticall happens if there
 	is no OBA at the point and if there is only one contract nominated at the point.  If we do not want
 	that to happen, we need to discuss our options. Thanks. Lynn

 Mike,
 
 Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  
 
 ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.
 
 I don't know the outcome of their conversation.
 
 I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?
 
 Call me if you have questions.
