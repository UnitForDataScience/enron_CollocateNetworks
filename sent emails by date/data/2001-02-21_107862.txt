 Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to 
 restructure this contract.

 I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
 job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
 coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
 provided you are happy with the numbers.

 ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.
