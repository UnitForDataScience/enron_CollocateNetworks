 the address a couple of times.
 
 
 
 



  
 
 I have to admit, I don't remember our having discussed this (although the 
 message suggest we have been considering it for some time).  What is this 
 website and what are we supposed to be looking at it for?  I apologize if we 
 let this slip, but I frankly have no memory of it.  In any event, I will look 
 at it as soon as possible.  Ken and I are both away this week but should be 
 able to look at it and get back to you beginning of next week.  Thanks.
