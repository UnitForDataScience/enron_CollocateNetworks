 Kaywill it take place and if so, 
 include lawyers?  Many thanks.
 

 Nancy,
 
 As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants
 Enron to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put
 this on your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we
 want to use as a starting point.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
