 Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I 
 see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I 
 also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and 
 not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH 
 by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?

 Draft memo on the functional alignment of South America under the new 
 organization.  Would like to send out to the South America organization 
 tonight to give people partial information on work in progress.  Silence is 
 bothering people a lot and the company is at risk of losing people.  
 Definitive organization memo out in the coming days, after complete 
 coordination with wholesale and retail in Houston.  Look at the first version 
 of the memo.  Please reply with any comments asap.
