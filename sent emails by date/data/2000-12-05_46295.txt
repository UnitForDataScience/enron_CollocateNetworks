 transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA 
 Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for 
 all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only 
 consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
 the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require 
 any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a 
 "governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All 
 other US products appear to be OK.
