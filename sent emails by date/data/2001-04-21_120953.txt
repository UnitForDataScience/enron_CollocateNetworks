 Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.  
 
 Thanks!
 
 Kim
 

 
  
 
 Kent,
 
 Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
 natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
 transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
 year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
 we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
 ready to transact.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
 by to help, too.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim Ward
