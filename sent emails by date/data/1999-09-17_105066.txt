 can be traded (albeit in a 
 more limited fashion) offshore.   Because money market instruments can't be 
 shorted locally, they are really just passive investment vehicles (like a 
 bank CD) off of which one trades the interest rate via swaps.  That is, you 
 are shortening or lengthening your investment horizon based on one's 
 expectation of rates and continually earning either a higher or lower carry 
 than market.  Most of this type of trading can be done offshore through 
 credit-linked notes (including R$ CDI, R$ prefixed and USD fixed) and 
 short-term Brazil Bradys.  Currency futures of course can be traded via NDFs.
 
 In sum, I think we need to better define the type of trades we will do and 
 where we are going to do those trades.  My hope is that we can define a 
 couple of products/ideas we want to implement now and then figure out in 
 which entity to house that activity.  
 
 I will try to set up a conference call for next week on this topic.

 Please review the attached memo to verify that I have identified all of the 
 products that you are interested in trading in Brazil.  I will be in Sao 
 Paulo on Monday, September 20, 1999.
 
 Thank you,
