 Hi Anthony,
 
 Please run a Sitara report for Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company to see any CURRENT deals pending for this counterparty.  Debra Perlingiere in Legal needs to know who the traders are dealing with this CP, so just spot check your list for about 20 deals.  I realize there are quite a few deals out there, but you can limit the list by running with flow dates from today forward.  Debra needs this information as soon as possible.  If you don't recognize any of the names who created the deal, check people finder.  Most of the book admins should be in the same cost center as the trader.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks!
