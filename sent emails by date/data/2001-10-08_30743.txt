 Tracy,

  << File: ISC Allocation Metrics.xls >> This is a recap at the business unit level.  The business unit allocation is weighted as follows:
 			29.27% based on how many licenses we have.
 			53.41% based on how many documents we have on the system.
 			17.32% based on the amount of CO data (or master data) we have on the system.
 
  << File: Stats by company for ETS.xls >> This is the detail of the documents (# of FI docs & # of PO docs columns) and the CO data (all other columns) ETS has on the system.....by company.
 
  << File: ISC ets licenses.xls >>   This is a list of the ETS users/licenses.  It is not by company.  
 
 Let me know if you have any questions,
 Greg
