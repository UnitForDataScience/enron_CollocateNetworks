       Yes, he will be returning as an Associate.  I don't think that Billy is coordinating this trip, but I'll check.

 Hello Danny-
 
 I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
 Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
 graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
 on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
 visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).
 
 I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
 be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
 Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
 during these days.  Thanks.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Rafael Rizo-Patron
