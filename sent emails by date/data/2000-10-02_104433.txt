      Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the Schedule and 
 Credit
 Support Annex to the referenced agreement.  It is our intention to replace the
 existing Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated as of May 28, 1992 between
 Enron Risk Management Services Corp. (now known as Enron North America Corp.)
 and Morgan Guaranty  (the "Existing Master Agreement") with the ISDA Master
 Agreement.   Under the exisiting Master Agreement, Enron Corp. executed a
 $50,000,000  Guaranty in favor of  Morgan Guaranty. The draft ISDA Master
 Agreement includes our updated form of Guaranty.  We can either amend the
 exisiting form of Guaranty or amend and restate the exisiting Guaranty with 
 our
 updated form of Guaranty.
 
      Should you have any questions or comments, please  call either Sara
 Shackleton (attorney) at (713) 853-5620 (email address:
