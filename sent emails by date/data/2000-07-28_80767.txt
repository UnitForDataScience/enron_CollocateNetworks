 Would you please contact this guy and see what he wants.  We need to 
 follow-up because his dad is on the board with me for JDF and he was the 
 number  2 guy at Compaq with Rod Canion.  He is a Ken Lay buddy as well.  
 Please find out if there is any synergies here and if not please simply 
 respond and say thanks no thanks.  We just don't want him to think that Enron 
 blew him off.
 
 Thanks and i hope it is not a waste of time.
 
 Mike
 

 
  
 
 
 Scott,
 
  I was following up on a few old items, has anyone contacted you from
 Enron?   If yes, please let me know, if not please resend email and i'll
 follow-up to make sure you get a response.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike McConnell
