 This e-mail is to confirm that we will use DealBench for the marketing of our 
 Midway, FL site. Kathleen Carnahan and Fred Mitro will be the individuals on 
 my team responsible for coordinating the effort of collecting and organizing 
 documents to be placed on line. We need to go live with this by Monday, April 
 2. We would appreciate your help in making this happen.
 
 Our cost center number for the $10,000 charge is 107319. Please let me know 
 if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben
