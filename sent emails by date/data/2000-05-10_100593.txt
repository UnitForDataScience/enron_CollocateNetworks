 would be appropriate (see language below), given that dereg. may bring some 
 changes we want to take advantage of.  It's basically your call:  if SPS were 
 to terminate our contract, how much time would we need to negotiate a 
 replacement?
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of 
 an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring 
 you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me 
 know and I will fax it to you.  
 
 In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
 described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
 if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
 then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
 for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
 handling, and I appreciate your patience.
