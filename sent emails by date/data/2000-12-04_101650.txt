 ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am

 fabric and comes in a v-neck style...
 
 I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is 
 buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift 
 certificate idea.  
 
 So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine 
 this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble!
 
 
 
 
 


  
  
 
 The doc thinks I probably had the flu.
