 coordinate with Sarah and Accounting.  Is it Mary Lynn that I should talk to?

 1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around
 yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through
 Corp (vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.
 
 2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that
 the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of
 reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an
 exhibit.  I will resend the email for your easy reference.
 
 Hope this helps.

 1-Is there anything left to do to change the name under the LLC agreement
 to enovate?
    2-I am attaching the overview cash protocol that was discussed during
 our meeting with Treasury, Accounting and Finance.  Who can begin crafting
 a services agreement around this template?
 (See attached file: Cash Protocol.doc)
 That's it for this moment.
 
 Thanks,
