 Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
 need  more.
 ?
 The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
 D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
 225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
 states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
 state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
 customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
 York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
 Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
 jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
 transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
 the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
 transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
 users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
 probably not before October  2001.
