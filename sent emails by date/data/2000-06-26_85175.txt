 from Hanover.  These guys are trying to renegotiate this deal.  Lets talk 
 about this after you have had a chance to review.
 
 
 


   
 
 this is our strawman, best shot at a methodology to get started;
 pls comment,
 I would like to proceed with this and try to get together in Denver
 sometime during the first week in July, maybe Weds & Thurs & or Friday or
 possibly
 the end of next week.
 We need this resolved, an acceptable consencious to allow us to proceed as
 necessary in the future.
 thx
 Jerry
