 How the hell is my globe-trotting, beach combing, vacation taking, cake
 baking, food preparing, favorite Enron employee?  I promised i wasn't going
 to let you go another 12 months before i talked to you again and i'm
 keeping my word.  We have a lot still to talk about in line with the
 conversation we had at the Ale House...you know, good times, good friends,
 good beer and deep conversation about love, career, marriage and what we do
 with our lives.  Respond when you can and I hope all is well with you.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 
 joe
