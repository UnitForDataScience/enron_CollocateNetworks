 The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
 rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and closed
 at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the street's estimate
 by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down the next morning (10/14).
 And despite the 330 point Dow rate cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the
 stock had trouble taking out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here,
 our sentiment analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
 ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had trouble
 advancing.
 
 We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue-chip
 Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from its summer high
 ($120) to close at $95.50 before its release Tuesday night (10/13).
 Here, Pfizer actually missed its estimated earnings by a nickel.
 Although the stock initially gapped down the next morning, it quickly
 rallied and closed higher. Our message: it's all about understanding
 and managing expectations.
 
 
 Pinnacle Index
 
 What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio at key
 overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be two (2) calls
 for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio reaches extremes levels,
 it can presage key turning points in the stock.  The average Pinnacle
 Index, therefore, should read 2.0.
 
 One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com from any
 other advisory services is our sentiment indicator or Pinnacle Index.
 The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure the level of overhead
 resistance at key overhead benchmark levels. This analysis can give
 savvy option traders a jump on other traders.
 
 It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
 sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
 that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
 our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
 experience has shown that the market is subject to a
 precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
 levels.
