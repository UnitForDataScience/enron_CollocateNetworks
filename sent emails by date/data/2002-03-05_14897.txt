
 
 Okay with me
 
  
 back to the Original Plan of $6.864M.  They viewed the reduction as more of a Current Estimate, so from this point, we will use the $6.864M as the official plan number for future comparisons.  (At least for Dynegy purposes.)
 I will resubmit the plan to Steve Kleb this afternoon.   Please inform Shelley about this latest development.
 Thanks,
 
 Nancy
