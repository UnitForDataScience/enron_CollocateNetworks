 However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.  The remainder are 
 senior specialists.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in 
 detail.  We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these 
 players away.  Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our 
 competitor, which will require that he have good people.  He will be moving 
 to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.  
 He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or 
 childless, their mobility factors could be high.  Enron would not want to 
 lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.

 Jeff, 
 I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we 
 talked about.   He told me that he would make a recommendation after he 
 completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately 
 compensate them.   He is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for 
 retention without market data. 
 If this is a very urgent issue for you please let us know.   If you suspect 
 that the managers are being made offers then please let us know.
