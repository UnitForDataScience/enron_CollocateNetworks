 Yes,  this is how we split this expense internally.
 Please, send it to me.

 Vince,
 ?
 Oh.? I sent an invoice to Habiba for AUS 5K a while back, and she  informed 
 me that she passed it along to the people who are handling the  agreement now 
 (I take that as Fiona Grant in London?).? I will then send  out another 
 invoice of AUS 5K in the next week or so for the remaining  balance.? Should 
 I have sent the invoice to you?
 ?
 Thanks,
 Julie
 
 
 

 


  
 
 Julie,
 
 As the book is about to be released to  the? market, I would like to start
 the
 process to issue the check  to Lacima.? Who will be the payee (Lacima) and
 what
 is the?  address?
