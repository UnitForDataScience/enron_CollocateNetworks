 Thanks a lot. Are you planning to make a general presentation on your work
 in the weather area? If this is the case, I would
 invite to our lunch meeting the traders from the Weather Derivatives
 desk.

 Shirley,
 
 The 21st is perfect.  I will go ahead and purchase my plane tickets.  Would 
 you
 please make me a hotel reservation for the night of the 21st?
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Frank Diebold
