 Dutch,
 
 Here's the info for Chase:
 
 Chase trader: Greg Crowley 
           phone: 212 834 4286
 
 TAGG no: VW1398.1 
 EOL no: 1707177
 
 15,000 a day (465,000 for month of October)
 
 We signed in error their confirmation showing 450,000 per month, but they legally agreed to 465,000 by clicking on the EOL trade.
 
 Sorry that error slipped through.
 Let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Diane Anderson
