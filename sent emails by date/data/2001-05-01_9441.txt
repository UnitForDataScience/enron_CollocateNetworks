 Contracts:  I met this morning with Robert Jones and Ryan Seleznov on contracts for Brent and Bob.  They were going to get with Michelle Cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day. (Legal has their offsite starting Wednesday, so we will be out of luck for legal help after today.)  I will keep you posted.  I believe that these new contracts will be well received. 
 
 Q2 Goals:  Patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and Philippe for next Monday at 3:00.

 Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team) 
 
 You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.  
 
 My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Causey.  In that meeting we review director level and above.  Rick has not set the date for that meeting.
