
 
 I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting on Tues re this 
 issue. I will include Mike Day. Is there anyone else that should be in this 
 meeting
 
 Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on 
 accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad.
