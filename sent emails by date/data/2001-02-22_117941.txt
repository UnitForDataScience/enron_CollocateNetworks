 use the system would be good.  We should definitely avoid being too technical.

 Mark  Would you be available on March 6th (around 3 - 3:30) to provide a 
 demo of EOL for the Chairman of the CFTC?  He'll be meeting with Jeff 
 Skilling before you, so  you'll be in good company!!
 
 Let me know if you can help us out.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Lisa
