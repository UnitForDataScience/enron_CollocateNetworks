 Sacramento  voted to approve the 1996 
 legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
 Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
 Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
 measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
 "As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
 I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very 
 little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
 deadline, too much gets done." 
 Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
 getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
 crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
 and countless hearings on the crisis. 
 A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
 Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight 
 bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
 on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
