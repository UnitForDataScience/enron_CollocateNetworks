                                            be hard-pressed to find two better 
 young horses than these two. Outside
                                            linebacker and pass rushing 
 specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super
                                            sophomore to keep your eyes on. 
 These guys all have good wheels, and
                                            will put the leather on you when 
 they get the chance. James' number 11
                                            Faulk's recent acquisition of 
 Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt
                                            many fans and commentators to make 
 countless puns and jokes related
                                            to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.
 
                                            5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly
 
                                            The other day I was scouring 
 through the many rolls of microfilm in the
                                            basement of Middleton Library at 
 LSU, and I stumbled upon this most
                                            interesting fact: 
 
                                            In August, 1958, LSU was picked to 
 finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.
                                            Auburn, which had won the national 
 championship the year prior with
                                            Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat 
 as conference champs, followed by
                                            Ole Miss and Mississippi State. 
 
                                            Of course, in spite of the dismal 
 preseason ranking by the SEC
                                            sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers 
 went on to record their only unblemished
                                            season and national college 
 football championship to date. This story
                                            should only serve to encourage 
 fans that are despondent over the
                                            outcome of the past two seasons in 
 Tigertown. Anything can happen in
                                            the SEC, and remember, the old 
 adage says that "history repeats itself."
 
                                            Keep the faith Tigerfans!
 
                                            Until next time...
