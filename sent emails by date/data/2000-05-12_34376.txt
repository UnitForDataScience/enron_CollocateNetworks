 this information is accurate.
 
 I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
 that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
 this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
 up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.
