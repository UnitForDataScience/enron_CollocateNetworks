 We are implementing a legal team meeting with a smaller group that will meet 
 during weeks when we don't have the all hands Legal Staff meeting.  The Legal 
 Team meeting will be held every other Friday at 9:00 Houston time (currently 
 12:00 noon S?o Paulo/Rio time) starting tomorrow.  The idea of the smaller 
 group meeting is to get updates on the key deals/assets in the region so we 
 can keep Houston current on a weekly basis when the larger legal staff 
 meeting is not scheduled.  
 
 While the group included on this call may change from time to time as deal 
 priorities change, currently I would like to allocate reporting 
 responsibility as follows:  Arap (key trading/origination deals); Watanabe 
 (Eletrobolt); Vasco (Elektro); Porto (CEG/Gas Business Unit); Mendoza 
 (Transredes sale process); and Novak (Cuiab?).
 
 I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.
 
 Rgds,
  John
