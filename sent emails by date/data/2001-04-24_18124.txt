 I'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to 
 all this evening.  I have a conference call at 7 am tomorrow.  Apologies.  
 But I think it's very important that we get together one last time to ensure 
 that we're all on the same page, that folks understand clearly what slides 
 they're responsible for presenting, etc.  What about lunch tomorrow (we're 
 all in the city), or at 5 PM (before the ball game)?  Lemme know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I do not have everything yet.  Still need info from Anil and Jeff with all
 the
 numbers.  Carolyn, would you mind condensing into 2 slides a summary of the
 acquisition events.  Similar to all the slides you have already done but
 just
 condensed.  I think that would be it.
 
 Wednesday morning works for me.  I'm going to a Giants game in the evening.
