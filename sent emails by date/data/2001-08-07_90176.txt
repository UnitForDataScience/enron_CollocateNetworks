
 
 I would pick the one with the highest return and put 100% in (most likely Stable Asset Fund)
 
  

 
  
 Kev....can you either call me or just write back to Cindy and tell her what  

 Thanks!  Ev

 Evelyn,
 
 Kevin told me to go with Stable Value or Money Market Funds.  Could you please ask him if I should do 50% each and if I should do the same for both 401K and 457.
 
 Thanks,
 Cindy
