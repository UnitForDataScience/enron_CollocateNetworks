 Marilyn:
 
 Sorry, it has taken me awhile to respond.
 
 Could you clarify that Liskow & Lewis is not representing TDC in a
 proceeding against Enron?
 
 Thanks.

 Laurie and Alan: confirming my call with Laurie today, our existing client
 has waived the potential conflict we mentioned, and I ask your advice as to
 whether Enron would also be willing to waive.
 
 The potential conflict is in a totally unrelated matter.  We represent TDC
 Corporation.  I understand that there is a dispute between TDC and Enron
 relating to a collar agreement.  I am not certain if this is merely in
 dispute or if it is the subject of litigation at this point.
 
 If Enron is not interested in our undertaking the representation at the
 Orion facility, we certainly understand.  If it is, would it be possible to
 obtain a waiver of the unrelated conflict?
 
 Thank you for your patience in this matter.  Marilyn
