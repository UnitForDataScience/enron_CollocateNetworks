
 
 Can you please change the name of the corporation from "Inc." to 
 "Incorporated".  Thanks.
 
     
 We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a 
 CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and 
 that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty?
