 What does your schedule look like the rest of the week?  I'd like to get 
 together with you and get a timeline for introduction of this.  Since I don't 
 think there is any major programming at all, my impression is that we could 
 get something out there as quickly as we can do all the legal work.   I also 
 need to know who else I need to include in this, what the next steps are, 
 etc.  Please let me know the process so we can get moving.  
 
 Thanks for your assistance.
