 what is your number at work?
 
   dad's just
    trying
    to explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would
    never
    want to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank
    at
    a decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I
    can
    avoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs
    and other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to
    come
    up with the $55K for the down payment.
 
    If writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a
    stable
    investment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7
    years, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long
    while.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing
    within 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either
    way.  Maybe you can call, or email me?
