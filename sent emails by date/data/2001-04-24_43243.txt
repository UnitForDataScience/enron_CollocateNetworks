 I can have this all finalized by Friday May 13.  Peggy/Stan - Let me know if 
 you need it done sooner.  thanks, Aaron

 Thank you for the summary Aaron, I don't think you misrepresented anything,
 but there are a couple places that I have questions, or the amounts you show
 are different than what I was expecting.
 1)My records showed our last discussion around Lobdell showed his sales bonus
 at $225,000. and this shows $250,000. which I am OK with, but if total dollars
 are limited, I might need the $25,000. for some other individuals.
 2) I had emailed before that Quennoz, Johnson, and Ryder were lower than the
 last plan, although this was the 'old' retention  plan. I had propposed
 Quennoz and Johnson going to $250,000., which gets them to previous level, and
 Ryder to $225,000., and that Barnett would need an increase to keep equity to
 $225,000. If $250,000. is too high for Johnson and Quennoz, I could probably
 be OK with $225,000. for each of them, but they should be as high as Nichols,
 and Barnett should also be as high as Nichols.
 3)I had also had Joyce Bell ask you a question about Mary Turina, and payment
 of sales bonus at earlier of sale or some timeframe like 2 to 3 years.
 Probably what I'm really suggesting here, is maybe we need to increase her
 retention, and decrease her sales or something like that, and a front loading
 might work here too, with incentive to have to stay.   
 Thanks for all your help and work on this Aaron. Please call if you have
 problems understand my notes. 503-464-8401

 Here are the numbers for the PGE retention programs.  
 
 Stan, I've reviewed Peggy's recommendations for these programs (Retention and
 Sales Bonus Programs) and they seem reasonable in light of the imminent
 divestiture of PGE and our associated needs - let me know if you're ok with
 the numbers.
 
 Peggy, let me know if I've misrepresented anything.
 
 I will be working with Kriste Sullivan (Enron attorney) to implement these
 agreements and supercede the prior agreements.  We are hoping to have the
 agreements signed and executed by May 13.
