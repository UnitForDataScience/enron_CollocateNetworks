 Hope everyone is well.  Attached is the final agenda for the AAI
 conference on market monitoring. The date is December 11 at NRECA's HQs
 in Arlington.  I appreciate all your input and help with putting this
 together.  We would like to invite about 40 people and give APPA, NRECA,
 and Enron 3-5 slots each at the table.  You can:  (1) invite people
 yourself (please let me know who they are when they confirm their
 attendance) or (2) let me know who to invite and I will e-mail them
 myself.
 
 Thanks,
 Diana Moss
