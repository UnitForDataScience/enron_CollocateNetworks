 Please see attached materials from Steve Kean.  Ken Lay and Steve Kean met 
 yesterday with the Governor of California and his policy director to discuss 
 solutions to California's energy problems. The meeting was very 
 constructive.  Ken Lay and Steve offered some of Enron's proposed solutions 
 and the Governor discussed the options he's considering.  We've been asked to 
 provide 
 not just the 5 one year strips.
 He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
 He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
 deal.
 He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
 forward contracting issues.
 Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.
