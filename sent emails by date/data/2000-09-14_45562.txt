 Thank you for providing Stephanie with the list of confirmations which went 
 out as Deemed ISDAs for the various Mexican counterparties during the August 
 rush.
 
 At this time, could you let me know which of my Mexican counterparties have 
 returned signed confirms.  My group includes:
 
 
 Deal Number(s) 	Mexican Counterparty
