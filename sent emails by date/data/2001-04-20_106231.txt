 Without making this too complicated, Frank Sayre wants to join in.  And I am 
 waiting to hear when Caroline Abramo will be in Houston.  Thursday and Friday 
 are not acceptable dates.  Please call me Monday morning.  Thanks.
 
 p.s.  The essential invitees are Fred, Paul, Caroline and either Carol or me.
