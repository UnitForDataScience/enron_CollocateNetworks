  pls. ask the pipe/LDC to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it.  Once we have those together, I'll run the traps with Legal.
 
 It would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier, then work on the second.
 
 I will be out of the office Thursday & Friday, but please call me on my cell phone at 713-516-2574 with any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Suzanne
