An Enron Policy Committee (essentially, our executive committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to Houston on Sunday night depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest flight on Monday morning arrives in Houston too late for me to attend the Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well! Let us know if your plans include a Houston tripthe Enron
    assignment goes to the top more often than not.
 
    You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be
    proud of what they have built.
 
 
    Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.
 
    Regards,
 
    Bill
