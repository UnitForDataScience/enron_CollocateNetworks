 I've been asked to provide an updated list on who is authorized to cross trade what commodities/products.  As soon as possible, please reply to this email with the names of only the authorized "cross commodity" traders and their respective commodities. (natural gas, crude, heat, gasoline, weather, precip, coal, power, forex (list currency), etc..)
 
 Thanks,
 
 Frank
 
 
 PS. Traders limited to one commodity do not need to be included on this list.
