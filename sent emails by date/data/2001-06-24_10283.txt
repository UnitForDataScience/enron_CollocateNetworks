 Following up on the Terra accounts receivable discussed at the last customer accounts status meeting, Frank Semin has indicated that he and Dave Neubauer have both been in contact with Terra and are working to resolve.  Frank is currently drafting a letter to Terra addressing the receivable and proposed resolution.
 
 Frank,  Please keep me posted on any progress.
 
 Thanks, Dana
