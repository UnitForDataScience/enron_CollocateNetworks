 and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if 
 they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They 
 claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be 
 penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.
 
 Thanks,
 mike

 All penalties below were netted in payments we received from Southwest Gas 
 Corporation.

 I need to know what counterparties invoiced ENA for Penalties ,or netted them 
 in a payment we received for December production. I will need the amount of 
 the Penalty , the Counterparty , and the deal that the penalty is related to .
 
 
 Unfortunately I need this information before you leave today.
 
 
 Let me know if you any questions
