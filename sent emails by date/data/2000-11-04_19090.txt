 Afternoon?  We can meet at my office if you'd like, or at a cafe.  Let me 
 know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hello everyone,
 
 I thought I missed something last night - there were four accidents on my 
 way home so I didn't even get into the city until 7:30 pm.  I checked my 
 email and didn't see anything so I don't feel so guilty now.
 
 I can meet on the weekend whenever.
