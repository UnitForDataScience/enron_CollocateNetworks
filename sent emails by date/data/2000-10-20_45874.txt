 Last week Tana and I discussed geeting the Australian ISDA Masrer Agreements 
 loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
 data base through Lotus Notes.
 
 The agreed actions were
 
 Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
 Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
 and explaining functionality.
 
 Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.
