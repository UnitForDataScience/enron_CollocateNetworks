 The HB was pretty wild.  We went to the Big XII CG.  Good game, bummer outcome.
 
 I think I would like to start the 529 plan for each kid.  Can I transfer either the custodial or Ed IRA $$??  I just tried to call, but no one answered.  With all the craziness here, I'm not sitting by my phone.  If you call, ask the person to messenger me.

 2001!  I believe that this year the limit has been raised on the Education
 IRA's.  Is this true?  If so, I would like to contribute more than the $500
 that it has been.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
