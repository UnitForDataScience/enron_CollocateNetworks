 electricity. Once again, retailers were stymied in their search for ways to
 cut their customers' bills.
 Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make
 more money selling in high volume to billion-dollar utilities on the Power
 Exchange, rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies.
 Wayne, the president of UtiliSource, learned the hard way. He was peddling
 electricity in California in early 1997, before the state created the Power
 Exchange. After arranging a good, but informal, deal with a Washington
 generator, he sent out hundreds of salespeople, took to the road himself and
 soon cornered 10,000 customers.
 But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal, Wayne said. The
 generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make
 selling on the open market.
 "That was an oh-my-god. They said, 'Why should we give you a discount when
 we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves?' " he said.
 Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less
 damaging ways. That includes billing customers who switch companies for
 certain overhead costs of their old utilities, such as weather forecasters
 and accountants involved in procuring electricity.
 In late 1999, a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public
 Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to
 pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave.
 Earlier this month, the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the
 retailers' argument but accepts the utilities' calculations of the expenses
 borne by retailers, an amount critics say is far too low.
 In dissenting, Commissioner Richard A. Bilas called the decision's paltry
 award to retailers another strike against them.
 "We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational
 markets," he said. "Energy service providers [retailers] have left the state
 in droves. . . . They need all the encouragement we can give them."
 
 Retailers Found Little Opportunity
 Be they multinational giants or kitchen-table entrepreneurs, retailers are
 dismayed by their experiences with deregulation.
 Enron spent $5 million trying to sell electricity in 1997 and the spring of
 1998. But, unable to offer enticing discounts, the firm picked up only
 30,000 customers.
 In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times, Enron Chief
 Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market
 forces pinned down in the retail sector. As a result, there was little money
 to be made and little incentive to stick around.
 "The more customers you signed up," Lay said, "the more [money] you lost."
 Last week, Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to
 PG&E. "In the end," Lay said, "we couldn't change the rules and we pulled
 out."
 On the other end of the spectrum, Paul Oshideri is now a one-man operation
 since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years
 trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy.
 "You don't have that many options," said Oshideri, who is still holding on
 to his 250 customers and vows not to quit. "What can you do? You can't do
 anything right now."
 Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities
 were retailers able to make a dent in the market. The small price reductions
 they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of
 electricity. The retailers also offered a variety of other services,
 including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient.
 Although fewer than 2% of all residential customers have switched to new
 energy companies, 13% of industrial users have done so, according to the
 Public Utilities Commission.
 "If they'd structured this differently they would have had households able
 to make big savings just like industrials," said Cal State Fullerton
 economist Robert Michaels.
 There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators
 designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition,
 or it just turned out that way.
 Jesse Knight, a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who
 dissented on the panel's deregulation plan, said the law is biased against
 retail competition.
 "But I don't think it was the legislation's intent to protect the monopoly,"
 Knight said.
 There is general agreement, however, that not enough attention was paid to
 the mechanics of the retail market.
 Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation, transmission and
 wholesale prices of electricity. The only provisions on the retail end
 simply allow consumers to shop for deals.
 Lay, the Enron executive, recalled that the utilities fought hard to
 maintain their customer base. The irony is that, with wholesale prices
 skyrocketing over the last six months, buying electricity for all those
 customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency.
 "With 20-20 hindsight, I expect they wish they'd agreed to more choice at
 the customer level," Lay said. "Then maybe they wouldn't be in the
 circumstances they're in."
