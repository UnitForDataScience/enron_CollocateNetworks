 Mary,
 Are you around - your voicemail message has said you were out for the day, for weeks.
 We have a need for a CRM system, but not a very complicated one, and I thought that the one that Tony Mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might fit the bill. He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities!
 
 Thanks,
 Richard
