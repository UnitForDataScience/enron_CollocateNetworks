 will print it out and bring it around for signature

 Tana -
 
 Peter's message below contains a form of NDA that was provided to New World 
 by both EBS and Enron Puerto Rico.  While I realize they are not Net Works, 
 if this form is acceptable, do we have to have special approval from ENW 
 management to use a different form?  Let me know because I have no problem 
 with the attached form and need to finalize this for Peter.
 
 Thanks.
