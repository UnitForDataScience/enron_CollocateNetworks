 I really want to live in Altadore. I hear that is where all the fly bitches hang. I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ? Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has a friend who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am thinking of checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do you have any ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?
