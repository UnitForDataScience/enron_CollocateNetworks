 him to fly down.
 
 
 



  
  
 
 Jean,
 Here is my resume. I would like to interview and meet people in natural gas
 or electricity.  My sense is that's the best place to start at Enron. You
 can reply to this e-mail or reach me at home at 773-667-6740 if you need to
 get in touch with me.
 Thanks,
 Erik
