 Here is today's list.
 
  << File: dec 11 unofficialized.xls >> 
 
 I have open questions for:
 
 Stacey - 2 west pwr books (by the way, good job on the gas books you guys have - I spoke with Casey and she'll officialize these tonight for the last time and we'll inactivate them tomorrow)
 Todd - GRM & weather - do you know when you might be able to start officializing these again?
 Michelle/Mark/John S - there are still a few books (exotics etc) that we should figure out what should be done
 David Oliver - UK-CRD-BRN-PRC - Mark said this one would be officialized.  It showed up as not officialized this am.
 Sheri - the exotic price still isn't being officialized.  Where do we stand on that one?
 Matt - steel & lumber - they showed up - we rolled the files from yesterday and uploaded them this morning - is this okay or were there terminations run through?
 
 Thanks
