 Richard:
 
 I propose the following text:
 
 As you are aware, we have discussed in the past, and intend to discuss in
 the future, the potential for settlement of the matters in dispute in the
 litigation currently pending between TVA and Enron in the United States
 District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  This letter is to
 confirm our mutual understanding that such discussions are confidential and
 not admissible in evidence in that litigation, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
 Evid. 408.
