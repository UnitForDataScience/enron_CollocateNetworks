 Yesterday morning during the all-employee staff update, Fernley Dyson, on=
 =20
 behalf of John Sherriff, provided staff with an update on the impact Enron=
 =01,s=20
 rapid growth in Europe is having on our overall space needs at Enron House.=
  =20
 It was acknowledged that this is an important subject and one about which=
 =20
 many employees have a lot of questions.=20
 
 The message was clear.  In the day to day decision-making process about Enr=
 on=01,
 s commercial activities, it is critical to understand what options are=20
 available and to keep as many avenues open as possible.  In turn, it is=20
 equally important to take this same approach when looking at Enron=01,s fut=
 ure=20
 office space requirements.
 
 What is the bottom line?
 
 Looking to the future, the preference would be for all London-based employe=
 es=20
 to be housed in a single location.
 
 One of the options under consideration is Canary Wharf, but we must stress=
 =20
 that no decision has been taken at this time.
 
 We are currently evaluating all the options available to us in the London=
 =20
 property market.
 
 If we are to move to a new building, it will not occur before 2003.
 
 We will be seeking input and feedback from employees as part of the=20
 decision-making process.
 
 We are committed to keeping the channels of communication open and to provi=
 de=20
 information to employees on a timely basis.=20
