 Vince, 
 I ran across this during my recruiting at Vanderbilt.  It is headed by Hans 
 Stoll, one of the leading derivative academicians in the country.  I looked 
 at their website briefly and thought you might be interested.  I have also 
 forwarded some email correspondence between Dr. Stoll and Joe Gordon, one of 
 our Associates and a former student of his at Owen School.  We have been very 
 successful lately in recruiting at Vanderbilt, both at the undergrad and MBA 
 levels, and have gotten some high quality people.  Please let me know if you 
 have any interest in this and I would be glad to follow up with Dr. Stoll or 
 help out in any way I can.
 
 Thank you,
 Mark Courtney
 

 
  
 
 Dr. Stoll:
 Sorry for the delay, but we haven't forgotten about your interest in having
 Enron participate in the FMRC.  Our holdup is determining who is the
 appropriate contact person at Enron (that, and neglect).  We're not sure if
 we should approach someone from trading, research, senior management, etc.
 Also, any additional information on the role the participating firms play
 would be helpful.
 
 Thanks,
 Joe Gordon
