 HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
 eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders 
 said. 
 Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler 
 weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.
 Some storage buying occurred in Texas "if they could make it work," a trader 
 said. 
 "It was a pretty uneventful day," a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. 
 Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas 
 ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. 
 A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
 Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California 
 alleviated demand in the West, traders said. 
 At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million 
 British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from 
 Monday. 
 At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, 
 down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. 
 In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of 
 $5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around 
 $5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. 
 The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 
 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due 
 to bad weather. 
 Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
 range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. 
 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar 
 range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. 
 At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. 
 At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu.
