 If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.
  
 Other thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.    I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.    In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center.
