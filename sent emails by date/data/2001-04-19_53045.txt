 Iris,
 
 Thanks.
 
 After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.
 
 Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS 
 cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could 
 greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major 
 data associated with these specific DUNS numbers.
 
 Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without 
 resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for 
 completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of 
 which fields, etc.).
 
 Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we 
 need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We 
 would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal 
 buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly 
 increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size, 
 etc.... redoing when more data is purchased.
 
 
 Any thoughts.
 
 
 
 Mike
