 THERE WERE CHANGES IN DOLLARS DUE TO THE TESTING COMPLETED LAST WEEK. THE 
 COMPRESSOR WHEEL 
 IS ADEQUATE FOR CONDITIONS BUT IF PRESSURE CHANGES   WHEEL OR CASE MAY 
 REQUIRE ATTENTION AT THAT TIME. 
 THE DRIVE NEEDS TO DEVELOP 13,000 H.P.  AND WITH A SERVICE FACTOR OF 1.2, A 
 15,OOO H.P. DRIVE IS RECOMMENDED.
