 do not have to the sign off on the required documentation. If it makes Britt 
 more comfortable, fine I'll do it. But I do not need to do so.

 Linda,
 
 Becky Stephens received a stack of invoices for the above cases today that 
 appear to be ones you sent to us for processing.   However, they do not have 
 approval signatures.  Do either you or Richard want to sign off on them, or 
 do you want Britt to do so with your authorization?
 
 Please let me know as soon as possible so we can get them processed.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Becky
