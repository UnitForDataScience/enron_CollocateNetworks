 PLEASE DO NOT send to the list: Computer Virus information, Internet Hoaxes,
 Fundraisers, Charities, Chain Letters (i.e., any story that says "pass this
 along...."), NO "Work-at-Home" spam, Political or Religious material. NO
 solicitation to sell any products {this includes your e-mail signature
 line).  Sending any of this will get you dropped off the list.  Please do
 not write and tell me you were unaware of the list rules.  This is a list
 for recipes and friendly talk only. Thanks to all the list members who have
 helped me put together this set of list rules!
