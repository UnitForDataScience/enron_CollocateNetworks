
 
 earnings are due out before the bell on Friday.
 We believe that there is a good possibility of a split
 announcement with earnings. If you don't want to risk holding
 over earnings, be sure to sell your options before the close
 on Thursday.  You can pick them up again if a split is announced.
 That is the conservative way to make this play. If you hold over,
 you risk a loss of capital, should Nokia disappoint. For those
 of you with high risk tolerance, please note that Nokia jumped
 $9 the day it announced it's last split.  It then ran up another
 $34 before the split.
