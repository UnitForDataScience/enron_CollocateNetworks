 I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look 
 at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS 
 desk.

 We  have not discussed EWS involvement in Term Sheets.  I would think 
 contract review would be enough (do you really want mor things to review?),  
 but will defer to your judgement.
