 told her to get more info.  I don't know if he is a good student or not.

 Man, that's news to me.  Is it a grade problem?  Or is he waffling (is OU

 Thanks

 Hey,
 What's going on?  I wanted to get up to date on recruiting.  I also wanted
 to ask you something.  I heard some info from my wife regarding a kid that
 was recruited and commited to UT from Jersey Village.
