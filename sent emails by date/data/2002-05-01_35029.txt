    Phil:
 
    After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the
    majority of
    the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small
    rounding
    differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several
    months
    where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.
 
    Let me know if you need further information from me.
