 we will make your requests to DB.

 Tana,
 
 Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
 suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
 Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I will
 review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
 mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
 addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
 if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
 the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.
 
 Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Clare
