 I've updated the price and the volume.  Please send Imad and me the updated confirmation for execution tomorrow.
 
 Please note that the confirm should contain the new language that Cynthia has added (Imad said that you were aware of this).  Please contact Imad if you have any additional questions.  Thanks.
