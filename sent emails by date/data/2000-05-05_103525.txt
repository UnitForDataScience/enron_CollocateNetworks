 Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson 
 to sign).  I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will 
 give you to add.  We do not need certificates or our typical authorized 
 trader list to send back.  However, we will have to authorize password 
 applicants on Goldman's form.  How does EOL keep track of this?  We will have 
 to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be 
 more) and I think he's still ENA.  I know that we will want to receive the 
 password very soon.  Thanks.  Sara
