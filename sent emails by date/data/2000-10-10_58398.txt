
 
 Spanish electricity company Union Electrica Fenosa SA
 (E.FEN) said late Tuesday it has reached an agreement with U.S. energy company
 Enron (ENE) to invest in energy infrastructure projects in the Dominican
 Republic.
   In a release, Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of a
 combined-cycle power plant with a 500MW potency, which will use natural gas
 from a regasification plant on the island nation.
   The 500MW potency is equivalent to 30% of the Caribbean island's electricity
 demand.
   The deal also includes a complimentary project, Fenosa said. This is the
 construction of a regasification plant on the republic's coastline, with a
 capacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups of
 combined-cycle plants with a potency of 1300MW.
   The investment for these two projects is seen at around $550 million, of
 which $100 million could come from Dominican companies, Fenosa said.
   Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin 
 in
 early 2001, with the power plant coming online in 2002. It will operate with
 combustible liquid until 2003, at which time the regasification plant comes
 online.
