 Dear Arthur and Martin:
  Scott Haiber who, as you know, has done virtually all of the brief writing
 in this matter, was called about an hour ago and told that, very
 unfortunately, his mother fell down the steps while visiting her sister in
 London and fractured her neck. Scott and his father are leaving for London
 this evening to be with her. We will, obviously, continue to work from this
 end on our Court filing, but I wanted to let you know our situation here in
 that Scott's absence will slow us down a bit.
