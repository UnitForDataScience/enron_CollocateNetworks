 Thanks so much.  I'm sending your revisions to Scott for review.  The
 Confirmation Reply has been totally red lined out of these attachments, but
 I am assuming that it remains as we originally designed it.  Please advise
 if this is not correct.  If your changes are accepted, I will print a copy
 and have Scott McGough execute it.  Please give me your fax number so that I
 can fax it to you.  Regards, Lin Reece

 Carol,  Please feel free to change the letter agreement.  The coversheet
 needs to remain as it is, because we are using this same sheet for all
 counterparties.  Thanks, Lin
