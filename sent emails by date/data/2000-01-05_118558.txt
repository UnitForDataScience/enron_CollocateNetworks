 conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is 
 the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the 
 online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue 
 the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are 
 not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't 
 know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs 
 a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem 
 getting one for them.

 Mark:  I'm not sure if Janice had the opportunity to talk to you about the 
 point of attaching GTC's to on-line confirms or not; however, since she is on 
 vacation this week and we started trading liquids on-line today, Alan 
 suggested that I contact you and find out the outcome of this ongoing 
 question.  Do we attach GTCs to each confirm that's sent out to the EOL 
 counterparty?
 
 Thanks.

 Have you had a chance to review and finalize the templates for any of our EOL 
 confirmations?    
 
 Also, have any decisions been made on "GTC" attachment/no attachment?
 
 Thanks for your help!
