 be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
 following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
 living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
 all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
 country.  Can you help?
