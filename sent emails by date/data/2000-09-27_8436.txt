 pretty large.  I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the 
 names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars 
 are associated with each one 


  
 Actually, counting the monetized counterparty that we lumped in it would be 4 
 counterparties.

 Brian,
 The answer to your question regarding the number of counterparties in 
 "reconciliation status" on the Delaney Report is 3.  Let me know if you have 
 any further questions.  Thanks
