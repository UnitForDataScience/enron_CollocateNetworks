 if they go 
 bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, 
 plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  
 Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we 
 should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted 
 and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through 
 this.
