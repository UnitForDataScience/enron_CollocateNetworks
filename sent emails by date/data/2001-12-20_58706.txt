 Clare,
 
 EPSC has been requested that each relocation request submitted is an "essential business" move.  When this has been established, it must be approved by a Vice President and/or an Officer of the Company of the requesting department.  Your request will be scheduled once approval is received.
 
 Please have the approval sent to Judy Martin.
 
 Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
 
 Judy Martin
