 Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
 involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.
 
 I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
 specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
 transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
 deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you. 
 
 Many thanks, 
 
 Shari

 Shari, 
 Robina Barker-Bennett from our London treasury group asked me to forward to 
 you an ISDA Master agreement from ETOL Trust.  I am going to send you this 
 document by air mail.
 It seems you have recieved already similair agreements from us. Robina 
 mentioned the Teeside ISDA in this context.
 Please give either Robina or me a call if you have questions.Thanks
 Jurgen.
 
 P.S.: I talked to Gunnar from SEB lately about the ISDA and they really seem 
 to be very slow in their legal department. Thanks for your up-dates.
