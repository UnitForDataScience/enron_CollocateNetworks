 Agghh!
 
 Tried to protest the move, saying that I couldn't make it to the Tuesday
 meeting, so she switched me to yet another team - which I will not mention -
 that couldn't have been worse if I had hand picked it.  So I told her that a
 phone call came in that confirmed I could change my plans and I am back to
 the second team - with Courtney, Kimberley, and Anil Sama.  It's a good
 team, though not as good as my first!  :)
 
 Oh, well!
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 thanks again for hosting.  most kind of you, and we seemed to make a lot of
 progress.  did you get enough money for dinner?
