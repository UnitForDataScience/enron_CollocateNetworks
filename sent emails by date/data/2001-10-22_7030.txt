 as far as enron, i think long term it is a buy, but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment.  i think in the short term we will definately see the teens.

 Good morning. Do you have any advice about whether I should unload ENE? Seems it cannot take a forward step without then taking 3 steps back. I have never seen a company so effectively shoot itself in the foot. What do you think?-L
