 I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 
 2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since 
 our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where 
 HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the 
 gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an 
 additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery 
 point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and 
 completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make 
 sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as 
 HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.
 
 Thanks for your help.
