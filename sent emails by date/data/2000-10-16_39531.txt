 This is complicated for oil companies.  Mobil Exxon only does hedging.  Shell 
 has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly 
 trading for profit.  BP Amoco is sort of in between.  It is very clear with 
 respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell 

 
  
 
 Dear Ms. Cunningham,
 We are hoping to apply for ISDA Subscriber Membership, but cannot find any
 mention on your website of the membership fees. Could you please advise what
 is the membership fee for Subscriber Membership?
 Many thanks!
