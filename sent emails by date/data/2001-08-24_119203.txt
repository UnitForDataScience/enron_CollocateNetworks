 Mark and Stacy:
 Because paragraph 2 of our form contemplates that there are annexes attached, if there end up being none after each group has had its input, I suggest that the last attorney reviewing the agreement delete that paragraph.  (Note that Power has no Annex to attach to BP's version.)  Thanks!
