 parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
 from the "gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
 managerial and senior supervisory personnel".  You can see the full details 
 of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
 draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
 and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
 applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
 to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
 its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
 the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
 lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
 staff to "fudge" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
 compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
 the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
 the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
 a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
 off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
 have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
 based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
 no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
 following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
 you, now.
  UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
 CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
 PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
 CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
 nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
 liability under Article 10.4(b).  
 Let me know if you have any questions about this.
