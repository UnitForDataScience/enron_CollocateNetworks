 IMPORTANT:  THE X.001796 BISTI ELECT. MOTOR REPAIRS NUMBER HAS BEEN "CANCELLED".  DO NOT TRY TO CHARGE INTO THIS NUMBER!!!!!!
 
 A PAF has been routed for a C.03 Overhaul number for all charges to this project.  As soon as I get the C.03 number I will forward to all concerned for charges.
 
 				Sorry about the confusion.		Thanks,  tj
