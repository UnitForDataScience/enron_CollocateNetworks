 overruns to your P&L if that is the case.

 Hey guys. I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how 
 this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff 
 Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible 
 for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial 
 operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, 
 managing NEPCO to the $88.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to 
 realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the 
 $88.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and 
 weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. 
 I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin 
 project and is accountable for its successful implementation. 
 
 If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.  Thanks.
