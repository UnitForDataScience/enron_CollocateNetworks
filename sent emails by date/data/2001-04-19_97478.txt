 Friday. Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard 
 today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that 
 they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge 
 our setoffs. Any news?

 I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process 
 of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron 
 completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the 
 Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to 
 hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file 
 something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the 
 possibility is out there.
