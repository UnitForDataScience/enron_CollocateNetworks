 Randy back.  I am still planning our Friday morning call (it should be short) 
 because I want your input on "tracking projects".  Brent will participate and 
 I haven't heard from anyone else.  Sara

 In an effort to establish regular communication on the progress of trading 
 issues (primarily related legal and tax perspectives)  in the S. Cone, Lynn 
 and I have agreed to conference on Friday, October 15 at 9 am (Houston time) 
 and weekly at that time.  Would anyone else like to participate this Friday?  
 If you are interested in participating on a weekly basis, are Fridays at 9 am 
 (Houston time) convenient for you?  My immediate concerns are financial 
 trading issues.  However, we can focus on all relevant issues as we so 
 determine.  I will create a "short list" to initiate discussion.  Thanks.  
 Sara
