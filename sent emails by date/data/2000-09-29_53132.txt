 Valeria:
 
 Would you be able to do the interview on the 14th or 15th instead of the
 13th?  Vince Kaminski, who would really like to interview you, has been
 called out of town on the 13th.  He will be back on the 14th.
 
 Also Grant Masson is conducting an Options Seminar on the 13th and
 would not be able to interview you until after 5:00 PM.
 
 Please let me know if we can just push the interview to the same time
 frame only on the 14th or 15th.
 
 Thanks!
