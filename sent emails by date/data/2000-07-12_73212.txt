           Jon and I met with East Coast Power this morning to discuss
 the contribution by El Paso of the GE Turbine for the Linden 7 Site.  The
 assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the
 assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word
 affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a
 49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I
 would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the
 word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East
 Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like
 to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue
 when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El
 Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an
 ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the
 presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this
 with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I
 would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,
 we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.
