 I'm trying to figure out what the 'Rules' are for the Bankruptcy and Credit 
 Default Swaps go as far as Guest Access to EnronOnline.
 
 Based upon your profile spreadsheet from Wednesday, here's what it looks 
 like.  Please let me know if there are any differences as I will be 
 communicating these rules to the London and Houston Product Control Groups.  
 
 Also, can you please tell me which countries Could and Could Not trade the 
 two products (with proper certification in place of course).  As discussed 
 earlier this week, I believe you will be communicating this to the Houston 
 Legal team directly... so I'm just asking as an fyi.
 
 Thanks,
 Lara
 
 In the table below - 'N' means the country can Not View the products, 'R' 
 means the country can View the products
 
 
 
 
 Also can you please tell me what the rules are for the following countries 
 for both Bankruptcy and CDS:
 Per Denis O'Connell, none of the below Countries can have VIEW access to 
 either CDS or Bankruptcy Swaps
