 is having any adverse effect?

 The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
 further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
 the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
 setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
 suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
 high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
 risk rule change on Monday.
