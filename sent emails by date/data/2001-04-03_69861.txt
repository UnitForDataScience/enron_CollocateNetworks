
 
  adopting an investment policy and investing funds 
 is clearly within the authority already granted to the Managing Member.   
 Obviously, though, it is in our best interests to make sure that Peoples is 
 comfortable with what we are doing,  We could probably also "customize" the 
 resolutions authorizing Enron to provide this service to address any concerns 
 that Peoples may have; however, I think it would be best if we did not 
 substantially depart from the existing Enron guidelines, as it may make it 
 more difficult for the treasury group to manage the funds if they are 
 required to operate by different rules.
 
 Feel free to pass this message on to Peoples, and feel free to call if you 
 have any questions before our Thursday call.
