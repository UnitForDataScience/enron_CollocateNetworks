 My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ... they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).  They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.  Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient)
  is that true?  John
