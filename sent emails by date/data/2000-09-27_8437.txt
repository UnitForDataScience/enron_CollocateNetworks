 others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of 
 packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake 
 that we can!  (Do you think that we will be invited?)  That really sounds 
 ugly, and I don't mean it to.  I think that your idea was a great one, but if 
 she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.  Let me 
 know when the deliberation process is completed!   National Charity League Senior Presentation (big
 dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and
 a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a
 row, January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work
 well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for
 you?  And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably
 works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by
 Sunday afternoon!!

 Hi...
 
 Talked to the little mother-to-be.  She said a shower would be grand.  She
 has some big presentation mid-January.  How does late January sound to you.
 Should we set a date now?  Am I turning into Mother?
