      LiveGraphics3D is a non-commercial Java 1.1 applet to display and
      rotate three-dimensional graphics produced by Mathematica in
      HTML pages. It may be used without charge for any
      non-commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
      and numeric mathematics by Wolfram Research, Inc.. Wolfram
      Research is also responsible for licensing LiveGraphics3D for
      commercial purposes.=20
 
      LiveGraphics3D enables all Mathematica users to put almost any
      three-dimensional graphics computed by Mathematica directly onto
      a HTML page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
      Java 1.1 (e.g. Communicator 4.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher)
      can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
      software.=20
 
      Additionally LiveGraphics3D is able to show animations, calculate
      stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
      backgrounds. =0F%=20
