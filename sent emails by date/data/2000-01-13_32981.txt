 confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less 
 and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS.
 
 
 
 

   
 Chris,
 
 Everything looks fine with the deal except the volumes.  The information that 
 CES gave us had at least twice as much volume on both of those tickets.  Do 
 they have the right to swing like that?
