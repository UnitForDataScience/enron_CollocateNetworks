 just 2 months away.
 
 I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to 
 deliver another success to Enron as a whole.  I'm sure glad that I know you 
 guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.  Don't 
 worry, I will not try any coding myself.
 
 Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London 
 Mark.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Dave
