   Hi Toot. Hope you start to feel better, soon. You have certainly had more
 than your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mail
 from Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what we
 were doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they were
 in any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simple
 with the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from last

 Champagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCC
 and find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L
