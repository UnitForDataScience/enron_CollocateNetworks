 I have scheduled a meeting with Larry Adams, the Asst. U.S. Attorney, and 
 Doug Kornreich, the Corps lawyer, for Wednesday at 10:30 AM.  Doug tells me 
 that VEPCO has told him that it plans to file a challenge to the GAO's 
 decision in the Court of Federal Claims this week.  I have also spoken to 
 Andy Holloman;  we will call him from the Venable office for a "download" on 
 the Colorado case.
 
 Ideas on D.C. counsel?  V&E or Venable are the logical choices;  offhand I 
 would propose V&E.
