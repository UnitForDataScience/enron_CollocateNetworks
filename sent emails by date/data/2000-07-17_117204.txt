 Jann, phoned this morning and asked me to pass this information to the group, 
 concerning Bobby Riggins. 
 Bobby is a member of a bicycle team, while cycling this weekend, he and 
 other members of his team were injured by a truck.? There was one death in 
 the injured group and the others with major injuries.? Bobby is one of those 
 with major injuries.? He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub 
 Hospital.? Ben Taub hospital is located at 1504 Taub Loop, Houston, Texas, 
 phone number: 713-793-2000.? He cannot accept calls, visits or flowers at 
 this time, since he is in the emergency room.? An update will be e-mailed, as 
 soon as one is available. 
 
 Keep Bobby, his team members and their families in your prayers.
