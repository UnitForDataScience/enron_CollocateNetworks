 Sara,
 
 Michael Moulton did a two year trade with SITA that we need to document under 
 a Deemed ISDA.  It is possible that they will end up wanting to use a 
 different entity and provide a guaranty.  Please prepare the Deemed ISDA with 
 the same credit terms as the original ISDA draft.  Let me know if you have 
 questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Tanya
