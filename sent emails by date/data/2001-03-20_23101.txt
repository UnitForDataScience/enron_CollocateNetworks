I believe our respective organizations make a great team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All the best.  Jim
 
  the Enron assignment goes to the top more often than not.
 
 You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be proud of what they have built.
 
 
 Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.
 
 Regards,
 
 Bill
