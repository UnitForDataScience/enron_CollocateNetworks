 I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a 
 reasonable decision.
 
 We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain 
 clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a 
 rather
 vague concept of what they want to accomplish.

 Vince: Can you shed any light on this? I'm confused (really confused).... 
 Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only 
 by Kean, Buy and Koening? And
 Do you think this means that we shouldn't meet on Thurs?
 Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and 
 start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the 
 Lab. 
 From a practical perspective, if we can't get what we want from this whole 
 thing, Rick's issue of "where AA is going with this" is really a mute point, 
 isn't it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort. 
 Would appreciate your insight and advice.
 Thanks.
 Amy
