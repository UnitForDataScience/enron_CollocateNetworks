 settlements group.  Did you ever resolve the issue?
 Apparently, two (2) identical trades were executed online on 9/11/00, one at 
 1:14 pm and the second at 1:28 pm.  Duke agrees wtih the first trade but not 
 the second.  Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.  Sara

 Sara,
 
 The Duke trader that selected this deal is KRBARBER.  This is how the 
 information shows up in the EOL server that I use.
