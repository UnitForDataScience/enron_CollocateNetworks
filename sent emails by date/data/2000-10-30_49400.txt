 ds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz
 
 where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.
 
 Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation 
 for the option price, regardless
 of mu.  
 
 With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No 
 problem.
 
 Question comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows, 
 say, mean-reverting process
 
 ds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz
 
 Apparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However, 
 using the delta hedging argument,
 we still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary 
 condition, we get the same BS formula.  
 Not fair !
 
 From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the 
 underlying, which is the lognormal distribution.
 My thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE 
 ?  The answer should be yes, but got to be
 from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the 
 delta-hedging argument ?
 
 Thanks.
