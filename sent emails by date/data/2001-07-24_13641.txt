 Hi Robin.  Hope all is going well in Bothell.  I have a quick question 
 about PRC ( the performance review process we use in Houston).  Does 
 NEPCO use the same process of 360 feedback, followed by assigning 
 employee ratings based on a preferred distribution, followed by 
 communication with the employee?  I heard that some parts of NEPCO use 
 it and some don't.  Could you give me the "lowdown?"  Thanks!
