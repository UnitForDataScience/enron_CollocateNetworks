 I would like for you to move with HPL to the new building to continue training.  I spoke with Ed the other day and let him know this.  Let me know if you have any concerns with this or if you have any questions.

 Bob,
 
 It looks as if my days in HPL are numbered as the transition gets closer and closer.  If you have any time, I would like to discuss with you further the exact plans for me.  
 
 I was told that I would be moving over to the other building with this group.  I just want to set up when I will be moving back.  I would like to slip right in and begin work immediately.  I would also like to get a clearer picture on what I will be doing.  I have a few more weeks to learn from my current group, and I will better be able to take advantage of that time if I can have a better understanding of my role in the new group.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Mike
