 FYI.  Is there anyone else that needs to sign off on this before we roll this 
 form out?

 Carol:
 
 As we discussed, Elizabeth and I are fine with the Cross-Commodity Guarantee 
 you circulated yesterday.  (By the way, we are revising our current physical 
 power guarantee to eliminate the 15-day cure period.)  One question:  Is ENA 
 the proper notice recipient in Section 7?  We direct notice to Enron Corp. in 
 our standard form.  
 
 After you have received Jeff's (et al.)  feedback, please send me a copy of 
 the final form of cross-commodity guarantee so that we can include in our 
 form file for all requests.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Leslie
