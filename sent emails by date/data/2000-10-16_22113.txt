 Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer 
 Marty's other questions?

 Dave,
 
 The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
 produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
 million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  
 
 The obstacles to closure are:
 - the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
 more
 - there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
 pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
 - the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
 to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M
 
 Deal Stats Are:
 
 Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
 Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
 Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
 O&M     $3   million/yr
 Total     $20 million/yr
 
 10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.
 
 Let me know if you need any further information.
 Thanks,
 Rodney
