 with my wife.  Although I have never worked with James, my view is he is a 
 marketer/originator/business developer.

 Scott:
 
 Thanks fo the lead.  Just a couple of quick questions: (1) How well do you 
 know James?  (2)  Depending upon your answer to #1, what type of role would 
 you see him playing in an ENA group?
 
 Hope all is well.
 
 
 Best regards - Max
