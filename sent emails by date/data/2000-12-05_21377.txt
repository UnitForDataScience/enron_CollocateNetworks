 Congrats on your deals. JinSung had apprised me that things went well and in 
 San Antonio I ran into Dave Delainey and he was very happy with the whole 
 thing.
 
 With the current NetWorks structure, and considering the benefits you have 
 derived, we want to charge you a nominal amount for each of these data 
 rooms.  We want to bill you 25k for each data room for a total of 175k.
 
 I know that at the beginning of the deal you had asked me this question and 
 my answer was 'we aint charging you' but the business model for us has 
 changed and we need to show revenues and income to external customers and 
 external partners we are trying to get to.  Hence we want to bill internal 
 customers whatever is the reasonable price of the service offered.
 
 I will call you later to discuss ( I did mention to Dave in San Antonio I was 
 going to have to do this, considering my business situation)
