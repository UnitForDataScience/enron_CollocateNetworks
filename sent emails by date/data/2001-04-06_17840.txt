 Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pac Gas) senior secured and preferred 
 securities into the default category based on the utility's voluntary filing 
 today of a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
 
 Fitch also believes that Pac Gas' bankruptcy filing could complicate Southern 
 California Edison's (So Cal Ed) likelihood of accomplishing a sale of its 
 transmission assets to the State of California. Consequently, Fitch has 
 lowered So Cal Ed's senior secured debt rating and changed the Ratings Watch 
 to Negative from Evolving. The Ratings Watch status of Edison International, 
 the parent of So Cal Ed, is also changed to Negative from Evolving. The new 
 ratings are:
 
 Pacific Gas and Electric Company
 
 
    First Mortgage Bonds to `DDD' from `B-`;
    Preferred Securities to `D' from `C';
    Commercial Paper `D' Unchanged;
    Rating Watch Not applicable Negative.
 
    Fitch does not rate the securities of PG&E Corp.
 
    Southern California Edison Company
 
    Senior Secured Debt to `CCC' from `B-`;
    Senior Unsecured Debt `CC' unchanged;
    Preferred Stock `C' unchanged;
    Commercial Paper `D' unchanged;
    Changed to Rating Watch Negative from Rating Watch Evolving.
 
    Edison International
 
    Senior Unsecured Notes `CC' unchanged;
    Trust Preferred Securities `C' unchanged;
    Commercial Paper `D' unchanged;

 owned subsidiary of Edison International, and is based in Rosemead, 
 California.
