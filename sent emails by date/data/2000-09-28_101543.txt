 Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
 anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
 before I go again.
 
 Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
 bedroom door open to the porch.
 
 Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum
