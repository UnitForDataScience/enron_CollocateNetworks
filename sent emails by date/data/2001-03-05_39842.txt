 time.  Mark

 FYI. This will greatly impact Matt's workload and availability for potential 
 EBS activities. I would like to visit with you about this.

 under early development, but should accelerate to match pace of no. 7 above.  
 Document will then be used to propose access to numerous other LNG vessel 
 owners/charterers who may wish to participate with Enron in making a market 
 for spare transportation capacity.  Initial draft underway in Houston, but 
 may be handed off to Singapore at some point.
 
 As you can see, there's presently quite a lot of activity being undertaken 
 from Singapore.  Much of this has arisen since the beginning of this year.  
 Nancy and I have been involved in preparing initial drafts, providing 
 comments, etc. from Houston (and occasional fly-in appearances)  and V V 
 presently has on-the-ground legal support from an excellent Linklaters Team 
 based in Singapore.  Matt Lee has now circled with V V's team and is 
 undergoing both intensive commercial LNG training and intensive LNG trading 
 contract training.  I suspect that on average this year, we could easily use 
 70-100% of  Matt Lee's time (depending on how the above activities progress).
 
 Kind regards,
 Dan
