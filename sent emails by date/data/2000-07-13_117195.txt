 are unsure.

 Susan,
 
 Please advise on the below issue-  this trade is from June 14th, and I 
 haven't heard anything back on it from your team.
 Please let me know as soon as you can in order for me to send out the confirm.
 
 Thanks,

 Susan,
 
 This deal with Anadarko is a little tricky.  It is a Gas Daily Call Option 
 with a cap.  I have added the cap language in the cash settlement paragraph.  
 Joe is ok with the change, but wanted to get your approval before sending out 
 to CP.  Let me know if language is ok.
 Thanks,
