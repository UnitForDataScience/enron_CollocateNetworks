Though BC Hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time, the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980s, and that resurrecting the plan would be a BC Hydro decision.
 Burrard Thermal Plant - BC Hydro has invested $250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions.
 
 Calpine has bought a 240 MW gas-fired co-generation plant called Campbell River on Vancouver Island.  This plant is "in the final stages of testing and is already generating."  Calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially "in the next few weeks."  BC Hydro will buy power from the plant for use on Vancouver Island. This is part of a plan to make Vancouver Island self-sufficient in electricity.  Another "key plank" in this plan is the Port Alberni plant, a 250 MW, independently-owned plant that is being sold to BC Hydro.  The plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply Vancouver Island.
