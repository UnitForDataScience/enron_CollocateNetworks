 want to give her a call too.  I'm sure she's a little stressed out right 
 now!  Maybe you could bring my bike & helmet when you come.

 Good Morning!!
 
 Phyllis, Carol and Monnie are all planning to make breakfast at 10 at BG.
 Did you get in touch with Holly and Lucinda?  Call anyone else you want...
 
 See you then.  I will bring your bike.
 
 I think I am only working til mid-day today.
 
 

 
  
 
 
 Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to
 get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been
 thinking about you.  Hope all is going well.

 Miss Tana,
 
 Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
 thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.
 
 I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
 10, or whatever...
 
 Let me know.
 
 Patti
