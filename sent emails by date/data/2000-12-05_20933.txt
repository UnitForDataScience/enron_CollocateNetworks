 I have already asked my team members to block out every Wednesday morning
 from 8am to 12pm for our fast time and it was feasible for all (Bonnie,
 myself, Cheryl S. & Betty).  If we need to change our time to comply with
 all the members of the prayer ministry, let me know and I will get the word
 out.
 
 God Bless All

 Sounds good!

 Please contact as many persons on your team and ask that they block out

 possible.

 Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
 name, I am there in the midst of them".
 
 Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,
 
 It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
 common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
 night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.
 
 It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
 every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
 strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.
 
 If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.
 
 Be Blessed
 Edith:-)
