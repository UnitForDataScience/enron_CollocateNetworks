 About $38 million of CalPERS money went to Enron Energy Services, which
 sells natural gas and electricity to industrial and commercial customers and
 helps them figure out better ways to keep down their energy use and costs.
 Three years later, CalPERS sold the investment back to Enron for about $124
 million, for a profit of $86 million.
 
 Another investment did even better. In 1999, the partnership put up $80
 million to buy some New Jersey cogeneration plants, which produce both
 electricity and steam. A mere four months later, a 49 percent interest in
 the plants, which cost the partnership $39.2 million, was sold to another
 company for $150 million.
 
 Each partner has invested about $300 million so far, with an average yearly
 rate of return of 100 percent. The remaining money in the partnership is
 expected to last another seven or eight years.
