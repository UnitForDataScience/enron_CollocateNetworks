 As you may be aware, since our last report to you, the Illinois Pollution
 Control Board has issued a report following hearings it conducted this
 summer and fall concerning peaker power plants in Illinois.  The report
 contains a number of recommendations to the Governor, including suggestions
 that rules be adopted to require air quality studies and public hearings as
 part of the permitting process, and that additional measures be taken as
 part of the permitting process to insure compliance with Illinois' noise
 regulations.  PMRW continues to monitor these developments.
