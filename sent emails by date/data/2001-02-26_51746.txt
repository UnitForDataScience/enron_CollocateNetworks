 other words, if you get x% of y enormous market, you'll get z in
 revenues. For instance, Enron says the global market for broadband
 and storage services will expand from $155 billion in 2001 to
 somewhere around $383 billion in 2004. "Even a modest market share
 and thin margins provide excellent potential here," writes Ed
 Tirello, a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown senior power strategist. The
 problem, as we know from innumerable failed dot-coms, is that the y
 enormous market doesn't always materialize on schedule. And Enron
 isn't leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and
 glitches that happen in any developing business.
 
    In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. "Enron is no
 black box," says Goldman's Fleischer. "That's like calling Michael
 Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to
 score every quarter." Then again, Jordan never had to promise to hit
 a certain number of shots in order to please investors.
