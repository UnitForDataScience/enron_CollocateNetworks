 We are working on the JCC project with the crude desk (Vasant
 Shanbhogue and Nelson Neal are involved in the project).
 We are meeting with Marc de la Roche tomorrow to present
 our findings about pricing and hedging.
 
 We shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over
 the phone.
 
 Vince
 
 P.S. You are right. The margins are fat. It looks like a great opportunity.
 
  
     
 Kinoshita,
 
 As we discussed earlier today on JCC, let's put the deals in front on our Research group and get a JCC deal done.  Pls provide some additional details here and I will also pass along.
 
 Joe
