 I still haven't heard from these folks.  I talked to Steven Smith last week on 10/24/01 and he said there were no issues with the MSA, but he was having a hard time finding someone to sign it.  I told Jane this info last week.  I haven't heard back from him either via email or phone, should I pursue this further?  One more call before I go out on maternity leave?  I know Jane is anxious to get this back signed.
 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks
