  if it became so big that sellers weren't just 
 owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing 
 tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to get this going 
 was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was 
 coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with 
 legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of 
 Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott advises me 
 that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the 
 physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the 
 global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow 
 now.
 
 I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to 
 pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the 
 buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the 
 freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a 
 explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in 
 London.
