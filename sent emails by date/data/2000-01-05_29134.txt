 Mike,
 
 At your request I reviewed the June 27, 1995 Operating Agreement between PG&E 
 and TW looking for any volume commitments and found only the following 
 reference:
 
 ? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of 
 delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities 
 "...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...".
 
 The Operating Agreement references an Interconnect Agreement between TW and 
 PG&E dated 3/16/92.  It does not appear that the Operating Agreement canceled 
 or superseded the Interconnect Agreement.  I am trying to find a copy of that 
 Interconnect Agreement to see if any quantity language is in it.
 
 Vig, do we have a certificate limit regarding the quantity we can deliver to 
 PG&E at Topock?
