 calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.  I did confirm 
 that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are 
 interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.  The weather should be 
 great here then. 
 
 I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do 
 something fun with the kids  the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
 highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
 to be in there a lot.
 
 Take Care,
 Stephanie
