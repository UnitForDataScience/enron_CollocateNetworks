 deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who 
 switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented 
 a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a 
 penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an 
 average monthly surcharge of $5.
 
 Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy 
 wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a 
 rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt 
 hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy 
 power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a 
 price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green 
 consumers' bills more than doubled."
 
 In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring 
 this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that 
 Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by 
 supply and demand.  The average person reading this could very easily come to 
 the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy 
 companies, which is clearly not the case.  Nonetheless, thought you might 
 find this of interest.
