 Can you make sure that the Toronto Office is not blowing their minds on 
 costs.

 Art,
 
 Please find attached my report on the PI installation at the ECP plants.  If 
 all goes as expected, we should be wrapped up by September 1.  The total cost 
 to date is approximately $75K with an additional $33K expected.  Please call 
 if you have any questions.
