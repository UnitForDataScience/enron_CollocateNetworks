 Mary Jo's deal.  
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
 

  
 Brad,
 
 In follow up to our meetin with Hilcorp yesterday, I am requesting that you 
 break out a segment from the original estimate for facilities. 
 
 We have determined that the immediate need will require is a cost estimate 
 for the inlet meter at the intersection of the two pipelines.  Hilcorp will 
 put in the tap on their line.  I would like to have a notional number of how 
 much that saves us also.
 
 Since the estimate is already complete, I am hoping you can just break out 
 this information.  Greg Sharp is looking for an answer of go or no go on this 
 project as early as this Friday (the 10th).  
 
 Please let me know if this is possible so that I can run some economics....
