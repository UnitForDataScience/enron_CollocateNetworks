 Joe -
 
 The Master Agreement with TM does not contemplate entering into Commodity 
 Transactions. Confirms with this CP will require special language to be 
 provided by Legal. Please make a note in Special Handling and contact Legal 
 if any further trades comes down. Once we have the language, we will need to 
 revise the Confirmation for the trade done 10/15, and Bob will need to create 
 a special template for TM.
