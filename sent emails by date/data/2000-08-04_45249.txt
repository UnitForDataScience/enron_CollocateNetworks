 Yes, I would still like to do a movie.  We are running 2 hours and 15
 minutes in the morning so I don't know what time I will be finished.  What
 is your plan for running?
 
 I don't need to spend a lot of time looking at the house, I just want you to
 have a look.  I would get to do all new landscaping so I am thinking about
 digging up plants at my house and putting them in pots before my property is
 sold.
 
 You for sure can't do it right after work??
 
 I need to run to the bank.  I will be right back.
