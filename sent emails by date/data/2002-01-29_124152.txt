 I think your resume looks good.  Brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes.  He says send a resume, call or both.

 Actually, it would be me.  Mike Mott, our Controller, has not started
 considering candidates yet but I'm leading the recruiting effort once he's
 ready to go.  Is this person willing to send her resume to me?  I'd gladly
 take her call as well.

 Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening
 previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss,
 who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave
 Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a
 management position, her resume should speak for itself.
 
 Let me know.
