 I got your "out of the office" message the other day when I emailed you, so I knew you would be busy when you got back in the office.  My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow, my afternoon looks a little better than the morning.  Next week looks wide open.  Would you mind waiting until next week?  I just want to make sure we are not holding you up.  Let me know your preference.  
 
 By the way, how did your testimony go on Big Sandy?  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
