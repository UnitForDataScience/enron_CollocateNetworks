 The answer to the 1st question is yes.
 The project list is fine with me and is still valid. We are an organization
 driven by the needs of our internal customers.
 
 I shall froward your message to the  person in EBS.
 Hopefully, we shall get a positive response.

 Dr. Kaminski,
 
 Sorry for the late response,
 it took me some time to coordinate things.
 Finally, it's almost dont :-)
 It turned out that from June to August
 will be best for me for work at ENRON
 (Say June.4 to August.4)
 
 But I still need to know several things from your side.
 Could you answer following questions?
 
 First:
 Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
 If so, let me know what to do for settlement
 during the period.
 
 Second:
 I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
 DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
 I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
 The list he sent is as following:
 
 > 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
 > questions like the following:
 > Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
 > sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
 > Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
 > as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
 > How many participants are recommended for a
 > successful live auction
 > What types of goods and services are best suited
 > for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
 > Opinions on lotting strategies
 > Trends in online private auctions
 
 > 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
 > or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
 > authors to post on our site
 
 > 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
 > literature (with hyperlinks?)
 
 > 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
 > services to our customers (if they are interested)
 
 Third:
 There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
 in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
 A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
 in e-marketplace payment initiative,
 where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
 along with Citibank.
 He asked me whether you can contact a person at
 ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
 He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
 to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.
 
 Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

 Fourth:
 My advisor wants to know whether
 there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
 regarding ENRON's business.
 He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
 Business model and System architecture...
 
 Thanks for reading this long email.
 I'll look forward to your answer..
 I am sorry for giving you so much burden
 to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.
 
 Warm regards,
 Jinbaek
