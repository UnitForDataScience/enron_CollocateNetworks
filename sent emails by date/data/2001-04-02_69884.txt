 We "took" her from El Paso, not that we like to steal from our customers (we
 may have another opening, by the way!!).  She's been here a couple of
 months.
 
 Just to be sure, I never saw these before correct?  She's going to do this
 job but Lee thought I had seen everything before and I could just sign off
