   the cover note ?
 
 Fernley  / Sally
 
 Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
 communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
 summary ).
 
 We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
 for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
 Enron Europe newsletter )
 
 Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
 
 Mike
