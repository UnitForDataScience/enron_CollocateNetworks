  David Freeman, seen a likely replacement for 
 Marcie Edwards on the board of governors of the California Independent System 
 Operator, said his first order of business would be to try and merge the ISO 
 and the California Power Exchange. 
      Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday. 
      An informal consensus among the board has already approved his 
 membership. 
      Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the $250 per megawatthour 
 wholesale power price cap in California is too high, and that he would like 
 to see it reduced below $100/MWh. 
      "I think my role (on the board) will help the state solve it's serious 
 generation shortage problem," Freeman said. 
      Some market participants said Freeman is expected to run for chair of 
 the ISO's board of governors, a seat currently held by Jan Smutny-Jones. 
      The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has this summer been able 
 to sell the ISO power in the real time market, and make a great profit for 
 itself in return.
