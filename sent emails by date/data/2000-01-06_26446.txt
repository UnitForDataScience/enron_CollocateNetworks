 The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
 meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.
 
 A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
 that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
 will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
 B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
 CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
 his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
 C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
 all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
 D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
 on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
 EDMS.
