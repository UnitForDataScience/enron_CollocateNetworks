 As we will need to change the Enron counterparty for Japanese weather to 
 Enron Japan Corp. (on EOL), please have the US GTC's forwarded to me, so that 
 I can begin the process of amending same to conform to Japanese 
 law/practice.   I believe this will be better than attempting to modify the 
 Australian GTC's.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
