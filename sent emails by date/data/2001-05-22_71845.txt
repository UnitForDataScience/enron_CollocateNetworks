 Either email or handwritten works for me.  I would just as soon have 
 everything now, if it is possible to get it to me in the today or tomorrow.
 
 In discussing the extension yesterday, the consensus was that we should 
 extend until June 29th.  If the deal gets done sooner, we can always have the 
 new doc supercede the old one.  I'm copying Heather and Reagan so that they 
 can  let me know if I've got it wrong.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
