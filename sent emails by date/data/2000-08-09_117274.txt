 seating charts from the other groups so I can figure out how to most 
 efficiently get people moved into their new homes.  We'll let you know as 
 soon as possible.

 Mark, I understand that I'm moving too.  When?  I'm going on vacation 
 starting August 26th and will be out that entire next week and also will be 
 out on August 18th to finish up my dental work.  I've already asked Joya to 
 let me know as soon as she does regarding firm dates so I can get Carol 
 packed and know where to send her things.  Please advise.  Thanks, Suz

 It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
 used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
 office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
 your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
 probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
 as much notice as possible.
 
 Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?
