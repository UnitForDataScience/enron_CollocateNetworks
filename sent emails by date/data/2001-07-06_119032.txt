 Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:
 
 Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position  there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!
 
 I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.
