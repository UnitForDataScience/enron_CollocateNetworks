 Steve,
 
 Enron Property Services may need us to move Accounting from the 9th to the 8th floor - this is due to the relocation of personnel from 21&22 to 9&10.  They are to get back to me today or early next week with more details.  Do we know already or would it be possible to expedite the answer to Accounting's long term home from an organizational standpoint?  Depending on the answer maybe it would be possible to move them to their 'final' home now (if it is outside of EEOS) instead of moving them twice.
 
 Please advise,
 Marilyn
