 So, based on the forgoing, assuming we can not and do not buy the property 
 until the LLC is owned by ENext then the terms of the POA docs should have no 
 balance sheet impact.  Do you agree?

 Greg has Christi's comments on the FPL Construction & Connection Agreement, 
 and he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we 
 engaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I'd like to have a 
 commercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance 
 to comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on 
 given his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?
 
 Please let me know. Thanks.
 
 Attached is the original generic form of FPL Connection and Construction 
 Agreement for your reference.
