 We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.
 
 There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.
 
 PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp
 
 Brooklyn Union
 
 Peoples - Laura Luce
 
 Enerconnect - Devries
 
 My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.
