 This is the complete list of ENRON Corp stock that I sold in 2000 and has all the relevent information on it.  
 
 Call if there are any questions.  BT 
 
     
 Mary, I was given your name from my HR rep out of Canada. I am looking for a report that supports my income tax filings in Canada and the US related to options that I exercised in Canada last year.  
 
 Can you please advise.
