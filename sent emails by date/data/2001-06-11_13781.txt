 Michelle:
 	By my calculation Alonzo Williams' answer date will be Dec. 26. He was
 served on November 29. I haven't heard anything.
 	It occurred to me that we often are successful in resolving these things
 quickly and cheaply by having someone at Enron call a contact at the new
 company, TXU, and bring the issue to a head. So far as I know no one has
 made such a call in this case.  I recall from the Union litigation a few
 years ago there was an Enron exec who went to TUFCO by the name of Mark
 McNally. We deposed Mark in that case and he was very professional and
 cooperative. McNally had been at Enron and (I believe) Houston Pipeline for
 15-17 years. He's now been with TXU 4 or 5 years and is CFO. A call to him
 might get this off dead center. I'm copying Mark on this email because I
 know Mark knows McNally well.
 	What do you think?
 	Best regards,
 	Bill
