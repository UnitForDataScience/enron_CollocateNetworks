  we support the 
 Senate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the 
 Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an 
 omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.  Consistent with 
 what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the 
 Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting 
 pieces of it as a compromise.
 
 We will be shoring up support for our position of "if anything moves forward, 
 it should be the Senate bill only" with Senate supporters and leadership in 
 the House and Senate.  We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who 
 supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in 
 case their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election 
 troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that 
 support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder 
 the blame for the bill's defeat.  In particular, we are hopeful that Senator 
 McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can 
 be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the 
 Senate bill.
 
 Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last 
 minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and 
 subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the 
 session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).  
 
 I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.
