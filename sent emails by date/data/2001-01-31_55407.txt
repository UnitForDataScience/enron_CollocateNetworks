 Christie,
 
 As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to 
 narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower 
 including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk 
 again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see if 
 he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.
 
 We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a 
 phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next 
 video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm 
 Houston time.
 
 We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you 
 can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his 
 expectations.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Enron Team 3 (Retail)
