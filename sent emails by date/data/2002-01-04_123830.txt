 They are rotating one person out a day starting Monday.  We will not be setting up the West books.  I would like to meet with you and Casey Monday morning if possible.  You can still be at home as long as we can call you.

 Heather and I will both be out Monday as part of the schedule rotation. Fran and Sam will be here. We will be alternating days off unless something comes up.
