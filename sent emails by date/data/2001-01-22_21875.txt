 corporate opportunity (ie) Laura, Hunter, etc.

 As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment 
 with the corresponding trading group, I assumed that Eastern Canada 
 origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
 with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
 previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
 division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
 organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
 strategically divide Eastern Canada?
 
 I would appreciate your direction or decision.
 
 Thanx,
 Laura
