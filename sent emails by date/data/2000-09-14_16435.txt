 SAN FRANCISC  well, it may just be the smoke rising from a lot of 
 consumers' ears. 
 You don't have to look far to see why officials at PG&E are feeling a little 
 desperate in their attempts to pass along their rising costs to consumers as 
 quickly as possible. Because the faster they can do it, the faster customers 
 might forget that PG&E had asked the PUC for an $800 million rate increase 
 earlier this year to help keep the lights in the corporate tower burning. 
 The utility was granted a $450 million increase, even though an 
 administrative law judge found that the company needed only half that amount 
 to meet its expenses. But what's a few hundred million between friends? 
 Yet the funny part is, PG&E officials said that rate increase would actually 
 lower our gas and electric bills, an event that happens on our shores about 
 as often as a tsunami. This energy-defying trick, which I first questioned in 
 February, would take place, we were told, because of cost savings within the 
 utility giant's other divisions. Yet if they were making more money, why did 
 PG&E need the PUC to give it close to a half billion in bill increases? 
 Well, the answer is that it would appear there are quite a few dim bulbs 
 making decisions about California's energy market, and Gov. Gray Davis hasn't 
 seen fit to replace them. 
 So don't be shocked if PG&E again gets its way, and once again customers are 
 ``serviced'' by state regulators to the tune of hundreds of millions in rate 
 increases, no matter how unfair or undeserved. PG&E said it would foot the 
 bill when it pushed for deregulation, and now that it's taking a huge hit for 
 past decisions, it wants to pass the buck. 
 It takes time to build up a reputation for Power, Greed & Excess. Energy 
 companies, after all, are anything but utilitarian.
