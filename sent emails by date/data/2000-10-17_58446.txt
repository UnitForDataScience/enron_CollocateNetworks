 forwarding to community relations to see if there is any interest there.

 Steve,  
 
 Ned Higgins fowarded this to me.  Evidently Kara's fiance is former ECT and 
 has just moved to KMI.  She has responded to the TW job posting, but she 
 might be a better fit somewhere else.  Thought you might want to look over 
 the resume.
