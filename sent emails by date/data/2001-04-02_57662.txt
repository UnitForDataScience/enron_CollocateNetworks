 Dear Mark
 ?
 I was just talking to Kyran, who mentioned your  impending move back to 
 Houston. I shall be disappointed to see you go, but  congratulate you and 
 wish you well.? Two things.
 1. Any further thoughts on the work we began to  talk about,and envisaged in 
 the contract? Or shall I wait to hear from your  successor?
 2. We spoke some time ago about a possible visit to  Houston. I shall be in 
 DC on Friday 20 April and Austin on weekend of 21/22  April. I thought of 
 visiting on Monday 23 April if that would be convenient and  if relevant 
 people would be available. My main interest would be Enron thinking  on US 
 developments such as retail, California, trading, Pools versus bilateral  
 markets, capacity auctions etc. Also Enron global strategy in other  
 countries.
 ?
 I gather you're off on holiday now. Enjoy the last  dose of British weather - 
 if you 
 can.
 ?
 Best wishes
 Stephen
