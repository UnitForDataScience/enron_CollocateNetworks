 I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss Enron North America Corp. from this litigation.  We provided Rex with an affidavit explaining that ENA is not a first measurer of gas, and he let us know this morning that as a result, he does not intend to pursue ENA.  I will believe it when I see the amended petition, which should be filed by the close of business tomorrow.  
 
 I will keep you updated.
 
 Andy
