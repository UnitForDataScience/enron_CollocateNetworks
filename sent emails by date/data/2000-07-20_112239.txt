 Henry:
 Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we
 discussed,
 I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since
 May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms
 and I
 have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6,
 Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  Alos, I have made
 the
 chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also
 acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity
 leave
 at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at
 713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get
 this
 finalized.
