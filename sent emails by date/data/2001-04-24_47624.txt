 =20
 legal team around the world, and I just heard back from the final critical=
 =20
 one.  We are OK with them trading the products below.  However, on physical=
 =20
 power, they can only trade west power.  Stephanie, will you need to open th=
 em=20
 up so they can trade immediately?

 Lisa/Stephanie, could you please ensure that the trading profiles for each =
 of=20
 the three PG&E entities are changed below such that by tomorrow morning the=
 y=20
 will be able to transact once we restore their headroom once we enter it in=
 to=20
 the system?
 
 Tana, are you OK with restoring the changes reflected below?  I'm thinking=
 =20
 that since they had this transact ability once before, that it should be OK=
 . =20
 
 PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANY PROBLEMS. =20
 
 Thanks all!
