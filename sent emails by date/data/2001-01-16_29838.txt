 Can you e-mail me the contract between Siemens and SCC?
 
 
 
 



 
  
 
 Laine, Rob and I spoke late last week about this as well.  Given the
 impracticality of bank involvement on a short time frame, we determined that
 EPE should proceed to negotiate what we believe to be a commercially
 reasonable agreement.  We will present the negotiated agreement to the banks
 later and deal with them in due course.  Rob, it think, was going to discuss
 this issue (among others presently facing the project) with the lenders this
 week.  Rob, feel free to chime in if I've misstated anything.
