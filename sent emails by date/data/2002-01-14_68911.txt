 that is absolutely hilarious.  I have heard a rumor that the Chargers are considering moving to LA....Is that correct?  That will be absolutely horrendous.  I saw the game of the century the other day on ESPN classics...Chargers vs. Dolphins 1983.  Truly awesome.  My man at the time Winslow(racist) got carried off three times.
