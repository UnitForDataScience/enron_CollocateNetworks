 It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall 
 elaborate on my 
 position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).

 Vince,
 
 John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and 
 potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with 
 in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which 
 is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which 
 discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to 
 value these options
 
 First, some additional information.
 
 Option characteristics:
  In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we 
 obviously do not exercise.
 
 We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able 
 to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and 
 the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach 
 our difficulty:  since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market 
 and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing 
 that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the 
 non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option 
 volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel 
 RAC's approach is double counting.
 
 If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  I'll give you a 
 call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.
 
 Regards,
 John Bottomley
