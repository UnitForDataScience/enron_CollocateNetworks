 When I spoke to Rob Stevens, he had a question about whether Mitsui needed to 
 review the final drafts of the GE agreements. I don't know the resolution of 
 that issue.
 
 As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days 
 of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the 
 contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui 
 can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui 
 bought in on the payment plan?
 
 I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff. I would also like 
 to make sure that Jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior 
 agreement with GE.

 K Bargainer;


  
 
 
 I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
 that Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to
 Enron Capital and Trade Resources, Corp.
 The initials at the ECT signature block is Doug Pedigo's.
 I have always been a little confused when Karl Siverling talks about
 voiding
 an
 MOU, because I do not remember ever seeing an MOU for the Cogen Tech units.
 Perhaps we could ask Karl to send us a copy of the document he intends to
 void to make the process easier.
