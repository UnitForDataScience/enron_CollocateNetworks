 Belden is the King!
  systems and processes.  Stephan or Chris W. may fit this 
 bill.  Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader.
 We have a person in Houston, Sanjeev Khanna, who used to work for Enmax and 
 now works for structuring in Houston.  He is not interested in relocating to 
 Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market.
 Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.  Derek 
 will work on this.  Sanjeev may have some ideas here.
 Establish better network connections between Portland and Calgary.  Dan 
 Dietrich.
 
 Volume Management
 Transition team - Murray O'Neil, Peggy H., Laura Scott
 Learn market rules for settlements.  Get 1 person from Derek's group to try 
 to spell out the settlements formulas on both the pool side and the contract 
 side.
 Compare Alberta Power Pool settlements procedures to California settlements 
 and determine whether Volume Management system will do the job.
 Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system will work.
 Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.  We are currently assessing 
 whether anyone from Portland could do this job.
 
 
 I will be out of the office until September 16th.  We have already made plans 
 for Bill G, Kathy, Peggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our 
 systems and processes.  Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down 
 the head trader position.  Tim Heizenrader will call Sanjeev to see if there 
 is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis effort.  It may be 
 worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.
 
 I'm off to Montana for a week.  Debra Davidson will be able to get in touch 
 with me.  She can be reached at 503-464-3820.
 
 Regards,
 Tim
