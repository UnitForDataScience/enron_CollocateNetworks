 Jim Fossum is about a hundred years old.  He's been employed by nearly every 
 storage developer operating in the state.  We knew him back in the early 90's 
 (that's 1990's) when he was trying to sell the "Ten Section" project to 
 Mojave Pipeline.   The Ten Section is the project referred to in the press 
 clipping near Bakersfield, CA.  Their other project ("Lodi") is in direct 
 competition with the "Wild Goose" storage project near Sacramento.
 
 
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 






 
  
 No, not that I know of.  I've never met the western Fossum, but I do know the 
 guys who own Western Hub pretty well Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
 "We
      expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 
 
      Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
 the Bakersfield
      area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
 expects to have
      more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
 California project
      moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 
 
      Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
 have to connect
      with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
 The combined
      Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area.
