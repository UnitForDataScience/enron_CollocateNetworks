 Nominations:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard to believe, but another year
 has passed...For those who don't<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know it, the
 Darwin Awards are awarded every year to the
 person(s)<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who died (or almost died) in the
 stupidest way, thus enhancing the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gene pool by
 their absence.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 nominees
 are:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 1: [San Jose Mercury
 News]:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unidentified man, using a shotgun
 like a club to break a former<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; girlfriend's
 windshield, accidentally shot himself to death
 when<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gun discharged, blowing a hole in his
 gut<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 2: [Kalamazoo
 Gazette]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Burns, 34, (a mechanic) of
 Alamo, Mich., was killed in March<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as he was
 trying to repair what police describe as a "farm
 type<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truck." Burns got a friend to drive the
 truck on a highway while<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns hung underneath
 so that he could ascertain the source of a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 troubling noise. Burns' clothes caught on something, however,
 and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the other man found Burns "wrapped in the
 drive shaft."<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 3:
 [Hickory Daily Record]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken Charles Barger, 47,
 accidentally shot himself to death in<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December
 in Newton, N.C. Awakening to the sound of a
 ringing<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telephone beside his bed, he reached
 for the phone but grabbed<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead a Smith
 Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he
 drew<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it to his
 ear.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 4: [UPI,
 Toronto]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police said a lawyer demonstrating
 the safety of windows in a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downtown Toronto
 skyscraper crashed through a pane with his<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 shoulder and plunged 24&nbsp; floors to his death. A police
 spokesman<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the
 courtyard of the Toronto<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dominion Bank Tower
 early Friday evening as he was explaining the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 strength of the building's windows to visiting law students.
 Hoy<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previously has conducted demonstration of
 window strength<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; according to police reports.
 Peter Lawyers, managing partner of<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the firm
 Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper
 that<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoy was "one of the best and brightest"
 members of the 200-man<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 association.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 5:
 [Bloomsburg News Service]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A terrible diet and
 room with no ventilation are being blamed for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was
 no<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark on his body but an autopsy showed
 large amounts of methane<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gas in his system.
 His diet had consisted primarily of beans and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the
 right<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of foods. It appears that
 the man died in his sleep<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from breathing the
 poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it
 wouldn't<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been fatal.&nbsp; But the man
 was shut up in his near air-tight<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 bedroom.&nbsp; According to the article, "He was a big man with a
 huge<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capacity for creating "this deadly gas."
 Three of the rescuers got<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sick and one was
 hospitalized.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 6: [The
 News of the Weird.]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Anderson Godwin
 made news of the Weird posthumously. He<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had
 spent several years awaiting South Carolina's electric
 chair<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a murder conviction before having his
 sentence reduced to life<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in prison. Whilst
 sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and
 was<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 electrocuted.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE NO. 7: ["The
 Indianapolis Star"].<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cigarette lighter may
 have triggered fatal explosion in Dunkirk,<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Indiana.&nbsp; A Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check
 the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barrel of a muzzle loader was killed
 Monday night when the weapon<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discharged in his
 face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home
 about<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:30 pm.&nbsp; Investigators said Pryor
 was cleaning a 54-caliber<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; muzzle loader that
 had not been firing properly. He was using the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder
 ignited<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 8: [Reuters,
 Mississauga, Ontario] A man cleaning a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bird
 Feeder on the balcony of his condominium apartment in
 this<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23
 stories to his death.&nbsp; Stefan<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macko, 55,
 was standing on a wheeled chair when the
 accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer
 of the Peel regional police.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It appears the
 chair moved and he went over the balcony,"
 Honer<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 said.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No.9: [Arkansas
 Democrat Gazette] Two local men were<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seriously
 injured when their pick-up truck left the road
 and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State
 Highway 38 early Monday<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning. Woodruff
 County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the
 accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortly after midnight Monday.
 Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Ray
 Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in
 serious<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition at Baptist Medical Center.
 The accident occurred as the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two men were
 returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On
 an<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up
 truck headlights<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malfunctioned.&nbsp; The two
 men concluded that the headlight fuse on<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
 older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse
 was<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not available,&nbsp; Wallis noticed that
 the .22 caliber bullet from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his pistol fit
 perfectly into the fuse box next to the
 steering<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheel column.&nbsp; Upon inserting
 the bullet, the headlights again<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; began to
 operate properly and the two men proceeded on
 east-bound<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the White River bridge.
 After traveling approximately 20<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles and
 just before crossing the river, the bullet
 apparently<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheated, discharged and struck
 Poole in the right testicle. The<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle
 swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement
 and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor
 cuts and abrasions from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the accident, but will
 require surgery to repair the other wound.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
 released.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God we weren't on that bridge
 when Thurston shot his balls<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off or we might
 both be dead" stated Wallis. "I've been a
 trooper<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ten years in this part of the
 world, but this is a first for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me. I can't
 believe that those two would admit how this
 accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happened," said Snyder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Upon being notified of the wreck,<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lavinia,
 Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had
 caught<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did anyone get them from the
 truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Way to go,
 Lavinia!)<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR><BR><BR>
