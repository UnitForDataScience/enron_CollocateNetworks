  that's where you come in.  We want each 
 of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
 represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.
 
 We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05.   Please call or e-mail 
 Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
 best for you on either of these days.  We expect the taping will only take 20 
 minutes or so.
 
 Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative.  Thanks 
 for your participation.
