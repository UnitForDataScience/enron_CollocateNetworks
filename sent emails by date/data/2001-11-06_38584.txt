 Mike, 
 
 I spoke with Andrea and Shelly from the A/A office and they informed me that there are currently positions available within West Gas Trading.  I am interested in the opportunity and would like to speak with you.  Please inform me on the current opportunities available and how you would like to proceed with this process in subsequent discussions.  You can contact me at x-57122.  
 
 I have attached a resume for your reference. 
 
 Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you.
