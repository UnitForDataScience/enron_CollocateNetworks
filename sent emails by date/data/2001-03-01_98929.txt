 potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an "indication" of a regulatory 
 disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
 "contract year" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
 those "old school" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
 10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
 the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
 analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
 to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).
 
 Let me know when you wish to follow up.
