 I modified the file you sent to me (see attached). For OPT TYPE, what is the code for a Call? for a Put?
 
 How does this modified model look? The data is monthly prices. I changed the formula for Vol. Did I get it right?

 Krishna,
 
 Please see attached data on the pages named "MO IND DATA" and "Basis Forwards". I am interested in understanding the math associated with valuing calls and puts on the spread between the index points. Also, do you have an option pricing model that I could have? My office number is 5-4173.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul
 
 P.S. Do you recall the work that you did for Kim Watson in the past?
