 was extraordinary, and the wine was better still.  Thanks so much for it 
 all.  You're very sweet.
 
 Almost makes any more engagements superfluous, don't you think.  (kidding!)
 
 Don't forget to water the tomatoes!
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 2 more celebratory items I forgot - well actually, I forgot one and did not
 know about the other...
 
 #1 - Jeff Dasovitch, Scott Laughlin, Cameron Sellers, Nancy Sellers, and
 Prentice Sellers - are all SMOKE FREE!!     Now that is something to
 celebrate!!
 
 and - - -#2 - drum roll  drum roll  drum roll  DRUM ROLL   DRUM ROLL   
 
 On Saturday, May 12, Mr. Scott Warner Laughlin asked Ms. Cameron Smith
 Sellers to marry him.  And she
 said............................................YES!!!!!   Isn't that just
 the most wonderful news!!!!!!!  We are all so happy and excited!
 
 
 OK - now for a wine tasting update.  Every "unit" should bring 2 bottles of
 each wine (1 won't make it with this large a crowd).  It does not have to be
 from your designated local area ( LizAnne was making noises about the
 Sonoma/Napa/Santa Cruz disparity) - it can just be something you think is
 yummy.
 
 Saturday night let's make it Pinot Noir and Sunday Chardonnay, since no one
 had any burning favorites!
 
 Chris and Cristina have a family reunion that they have to attend  - but
 they promise that the THREE of them will be with us next year!  We will
 really miss you guys!
 
 Anything else?
