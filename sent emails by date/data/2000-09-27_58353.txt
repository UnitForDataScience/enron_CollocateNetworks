 Steve, I believe the answer is that we don't mandate a specific format for 
 dates for all locations but rather use what is done locally

 Dear Ms. Clark,
 
 Here is my question:
 
 Would you allow our staff and customers to vote on Enron adopting the 
 International Standards Organization Specification for formatting dates (i.e. 
 "YYYY-MM-DD")?
 
 Please let me know if you would like me to send you a list of the many 
 advantages in using the ISO standards.
 
 I asked Ken Lay this question a few years ago, but he thought we should use 
 local customs; however, as we are becoming more international and more 
 internet-based, the ISO standard is becoming more advantageous.
 
 Thank you,
 Dave Fabian
