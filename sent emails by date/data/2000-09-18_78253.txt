 I don't run across many people without email these days. Big hassle.  It is 
 so much easier to check for certain issues with an electronic copy.
 
 I'm looking for the Fehr option, but the latest I have on my computer is the 
 version I emailed to you on August 30th.  Is there a more up-to-date version, 
 and if so, could you please mail it to me?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 The Village's attorney drafted the agreement and therefore we do not have an
 electronic version
