 All,
 
 Please find attached the revised structure for the Alberta pre-pay. 
 
 
 The diagrams are accompanied by narrative & should provide some clarity.
 
 Please note that the numbers used are not actual proposed prices/volumes & 
 have just been used for the purpose of illustrating the structure.  
 
 Regards,
 
 Soma
