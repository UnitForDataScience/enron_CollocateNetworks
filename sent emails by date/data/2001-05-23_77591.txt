 I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
 remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
 will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
 closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
 Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
 if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
 and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
 this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
 together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
 of our accounting requirements.

 Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
 I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
 Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
 Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
 necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.
 

 

 
 If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
 good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
 you.
 
 Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
 the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
 the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.
