 Hello, I have never done a deal like this.  I did not work on the Moosehead 
 deal.  I will look at it incase he does want a confirm after the counterparty 
 looks at the term sheet.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
 
 
 

  
 Melissa:  It looks like we'll need GTC's for a yet to be named FP&L 
 counterparty to do this daily call option (spread).  Credit (Ed Sacks) knows 
 about this deal.  You may want to think about the format.  Have we done this 
 before?  Did you work on the Moosehead (Merrill Lynch) deal?  Sara
  if it's not evident, this proposed transaction is with the 
 unregulated marketing sub of Florida Power & Light, not the regulated 
 utility.  We have done other trades with this entity so I'm assuming we're 
 all set with Master Agreement, etc.  Does our basic Master cover financial 
 structures like the one outlined in the attached?
 
 Any comments/feedback you have would be much appreciated.  Thanks
 
 Regards
 John
