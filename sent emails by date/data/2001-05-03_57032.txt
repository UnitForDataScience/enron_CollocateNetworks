 This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
 He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.
 
 As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.
 
 Thanks,
