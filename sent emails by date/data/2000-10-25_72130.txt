 Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is 
 optionality.
 
 I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.  As you know, if 
 this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment 
 to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.  As 
 far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the 
 possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in 
 the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to 
 see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for 
 financing purposes or otherwise).  In that case, we may want to use an LLC 
 instead of messing with an assignment later.
 
 I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what 
 we need to keep in mind.
 
 Kay
 
 
    
 	
 	

 	
 


 
  
 I will send you comments via e-mail periodically as I read sections.  Here 
 are my comments thru Section 5.
 
 1.  Shouldn't the agreement be in the name of ENA?
 2.  Section 2.1Why is "to be discussed" shown?  I thought that FCE agreed.
