 Chas - I left a message on your voice mail regarding Tim Belden, who heads
 up our west power desk.  Tim can be reached at 503-464-3820 (Portland).
 
 Tim - Chuck Brown is a principal in Newport Generation (Irvine), and is
 developing a gas- fired merchant generating station in the Pacific
 Northwest.  He would like to talk with you about a PPA / marketing
 agreement for the output of the station.  His number is 949-475-9570.
 Please contact Chuck to discuss the details.  Thanks.
 
 I am in London this week and can be reached at 44-20-7783-4160 if either of
 you would like any additional information.  Otherwise I leave it in your
 capable hands to get together.
 
 Cheers,
 
 George
