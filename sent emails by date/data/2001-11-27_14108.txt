 I think it should state:  Confidential and Proprietary 
     
 As soon as we receive notice to move ahead, generalists will receive a training binder outlining the process of the WARN notifications.  I assume we need to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary.  Is there any specific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on each page?  Please let me know ASAP so I can finalize the documents.
 
 Thanks - Tana
