 Hi David & Sheila,
 
 As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
 you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)
 
 As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
 price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
 333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
 higher number of shares.
 
 We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
 to let them know that the order is coming in.
 
 Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W), 

 
 Our contact information is :
