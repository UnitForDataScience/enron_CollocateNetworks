 The Northern Border guys would like to recognize their $500,000 in earnings 
 associated with  the Kern Capacity that they syndicated in the 3rd Quarter 
 and make it part of the Master Service Agreement between ENA and Crestone.  
 This is the document that they proposed.  We should recognize some additional 
 float given the lag in the payment date.  Gerald can you approve this from a 
 legal standpoint?

 Dan,  Attached please find the Service Schedule with the changes we discussed 
 today.  Call with any questions.
