 please give it one more careful look on Monday AM and it 
 should be good to go.  DF

 I have tried to incorporate comments from our meeting last Thursday as well 
 as written comments provided to me.  There are still some areas that we need 
 to decide on.  For example, we need to determine if arbitrage argument works 
 and finalize related Exhibits.  Also, re:  daily imbalance pricing at points 
 that have EFM, are we keeping the 25,000 Dth??  Also, I'm not sure whether we 
 confirmed that we have only called one Alert Day since 1994.  Finally, we 
 need to double check the tariff language on autobalancing per note on page 29 
 of draft.  Please review and provide me with comments early on Monday.  
 Thanks.  Maria
