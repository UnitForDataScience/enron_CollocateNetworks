 Dow Jones Newswires
 HELSINKI, Finland  a major retreat by a company once 
 famous for manufacturing the most-sophisticated cellular phones in the world.
 Nokia said it has reacted to the changing market conditions by accelerating 
 programs to improve efficiency and cut costs, but it didn't provide details.
 The company also said it has widened its market share in the handset market 
 above the 32% it achieved in 2000. And it said its own stock levels, as well 
 as the stock levels of Nokia phones already shipped to stores, are lower than 
 at the end of 2000.
 "More challenging times like these test your mettle as a company," Mr. Ollila 
 said. "We believe that truly great companies emerge from challenging times 
 much stronger."
 The company said it would comment further on its performance on April 20, 
 when it releases first-quarter results.
