 Still working it though.

 I've made a few changes.  I've heard from Greg and OpCo is on-board.
 
 One remaining question is whether we go in offering to pay demand charges for the total 2.5Bcf or only the 1.9+Bcf actually used during this period, given that the gas was trapped.  The ratable amount is approximately $100k lower than the $575k in the letter.  If for no other reason, from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number.  Mark, do you have a view on this?  If our legal analysis is clearly based on demand charges at the maximum volume, we probably should stay with the $575k.
