 a wide variety of approaches.  What we specifically discussed, and what scott 
 s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, 
 the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically 
 determined) for addressing updates.  We agreed to start with the top 20 
 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.
 
 I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.  In the ENA 
 context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which 
 was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).  
 Let's just get this done.

 I received word late last week that Dave Gorte (works for Rick Buy) is 
 setting up a meeting to discuss the process under which EES will have its 
 deals considered by RAC.
 
 I think that we should argue that the following package of information be 
 pre-assembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC:
 
 1. List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 
 
 2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in 
 the deal.  Not just the "scalars" but also the absolute $/Mwh.
 
 3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the 
 curves - 
  a. deregulation date (if any)
  b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any)
  c. standard offer end date (if any)
  d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any)
 
 4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for 
 example, movement in pricing terms given some event)
 
 I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this 
 package.  
 
 If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be 
 game.
 
 Thanks.
