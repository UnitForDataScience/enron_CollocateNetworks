 Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
 counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
 information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
 have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
 the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

 Hi,
 I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
 understand why Russell would not
 want to provide this exposure information to us.
 
 As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
 date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.
 
 I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
 'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
 on the following spreadsheet.
 
 I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.
 
 
 Thanks
 David
