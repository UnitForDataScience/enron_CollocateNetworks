 to read all those emails you sent me?

 To summarize the policy set forth below. . .
 
 1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
 production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
 current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 
 
 2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
 handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
 in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.
 
 3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
 within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.
 
 4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
 unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
 effective 12/1999 production forward.  
 
 Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
 necessary, please forward to your teams.
 Thanks,
 Carrie
 
  we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
 the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
 we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.
