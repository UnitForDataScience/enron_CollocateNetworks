 with Sheila (or have you already contacted her?).  I don't know the timing 
 for this transaction.  How long will it take to open the account?  Feel free 
 to grab the docs.  SS

 Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
 that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
 Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
 changed.  Please advise.

 I will be out on maternity leave soon (hopefully).  In my absence, please 
 call Sheila Glover (3-3210) for any questions that you may have.  If you just 
 need a copy of an old report, please call Aneela Charania at 3-0951.
 
 Thanks,
