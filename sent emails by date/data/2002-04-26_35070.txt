 Thanks Drew.

 Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  
 
 Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.
 
 Thanks
