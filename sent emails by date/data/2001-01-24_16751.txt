 up the pieces, 3) once written, pass around the pieces to see if anyone has 
 any strong feelings about what folks had pulled together, and then, for each 
 case, 4) designate one person as the "assembler" of the pieces.  (We 
 designated who would be responsible for which cases at the beginning of the 
 semester.)  And yes, all by email (save for, say, the preliminary chat).  It 
 worked well.  But I'm flexible, if folks want to try another angle.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 good idea to do it.  I'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us
 the file.  My preference (in order to actually learn something
