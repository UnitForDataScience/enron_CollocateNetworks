 By the way...that is the best damn chocolate cake i have ever had...that was exactly what i was looking for.

 2-12" cakes may work ok but you might swap the positions about half way
 through the cooking time.I'm pretty sure it will take longer than the
 prescribed time but it will work. To acurately test them,touch the top of
 each layer.If the finger marks bounce back you're there.If they remain
 indented.bake a little longer.Perhaps 2 minutes at a time.If you have any
 pressing issues call my cell(713-725-2676) Good luck    Den
