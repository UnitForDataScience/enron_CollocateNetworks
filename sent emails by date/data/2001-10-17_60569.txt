 Brian or Jean please co-ordinate your response through Faith Killen.
 
  
     
 Geoff:  I understand that I need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the Enron America's.  Currently  $  299,871 is budgeted for allocation to EA.  My group coordinates JV activities as well as conducting due diligence on IT areas related to aquisitions and divestitures.  The amount budgeted above is for the following known projects:
 
 		Coordination and Operations under the Bridgeline IT Services Agreement
 		Due Diligence related to Project Sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in Bridgeline
 
 In 2002 ENA will bill Bridgeline $1,250,000 for IT Services.  Since Chevron/Texaco covers 60% of the bill ENA will net $750,000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group.  
 
 Let me know if you'd like to get together and discuss this in any detail.
