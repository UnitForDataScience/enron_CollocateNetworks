 Phillip,
 
 I tried to breakout the curves that Keith and Frank will be setting in the file you have been working in.  We probably should run these past them to make sure 
  
     
 Can you get together with Zach on Thursday or Friday and walk him through a simple book.  Take Jane Tholt's book and discuss Risk 101.
 
 
 Send him an email with a time and place.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
