 duckMarch 9th, but 
 if there's something planned for that evening, I intend to tell my buddies at 
 Enron that I can't make the meeting.  Please let me know so that I can cancel 
 Houston in advance.
 
 Finally, and MOST important.  Today is the Man in Black's birthday.  God 
 bless the real king, Johnny Cash.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
