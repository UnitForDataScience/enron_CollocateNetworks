
 
 I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th 
 was not opened by HR.  Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for 
 clarification on Brent Price.  This was the second e:mail that I had sent to 
 Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.  My first message had noted for Kim 
 that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey 
 planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.  Can you 
 clarify this for me?  Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM 
 and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.  
 
 Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level:
 
    Superior  Excellent Strong Satisfactory    Needs Improv.  Issues
 
 VP's      Price  Hedstrom
       Hall
 
 Sr. Directors Solmonson Reeves Herod Scribner
 
 Directors  Thomas  Mills  Superty Henenberg Perez   
       Wilson   Venturatos

 Sally,
 
 Attached is a spreadsheet with pull down boxes allowing you to assign 
 preliminary rankings of your people.  If you have any questions please let me 
 know.
 
 Please assign preliminary ratings and return the spreadsheet to me by close 
 of business Wednesday, November 29th.
 
 Thanks,
 Kim
