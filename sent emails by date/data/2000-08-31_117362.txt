 language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for 
 transactions used by the back office.  Each transaction would therefore 
 require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more 
 cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.  There is no down-side to 
 having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we 
 agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm 
 stage.  You can say "it's enough if the terms are referred to in the 
 confirmation" for ALL of the terms of the master.  Since we would insist on 
 the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a 
 problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is.  With 
 respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit.  It is certainly not 
 necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist 
 on collateral.  In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may 
 well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.  It strikes me as 
 disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with 
 nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial 
 parties as well as financial parties.

 Mark-
 
 We have received some preliminary comments from IBJ, attached hereto for your 
 review.  Please give me your thoughts regarding deletion of Part 6 of the 
 Schedule and not utilizing the CSA.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
