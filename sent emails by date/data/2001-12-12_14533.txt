
 
 The offers to help you keep rolling in.  
 
  feel free to change my selections.  They 
 were picked only because the kids know these songs.  It is particularly a
 joy 
 to hear them sing the chorus of "The First Noel."
 
 Babara Thompson - I was hoping that you could ask the children at children's
 
 church whether any of them are interested in volunteering to read for the 
 worship .
 
 Stephanie - I am hoping that you can line up an adult leader willing to play
 
 overall MC and to read the Christmas message.  If you find someone- please 
 let Patty know.  Otherwise I think she may be amenable to pinchhit.
 
 Lisa C. - Could you please line up a greeter/door tender for the worship.  
 And, also check with the trustees to make sure the sanctuary is unlocked in 
 time.
 
 
 Thanks everyone.  I just lover rattling off email orders!
