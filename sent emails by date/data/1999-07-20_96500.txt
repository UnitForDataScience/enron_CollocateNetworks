   exceeded plan in 1998 and have exceeded plan in Q1 and 
 Q2 of 1999.  He wants to see this success continue.  Jim expects to spend at 
 least one day out of every two weeks up here.  I am looking forward to 
 working with Jim.  He has done an outstanding job running the east power 
 desk.  This should enable us to increase coordination between the two groups 
 and allow us to have a strong advocate in Houston.  While it's too early to 
 say anything definitively, I don't expect much to change on a day to day 
 basis here.  If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
