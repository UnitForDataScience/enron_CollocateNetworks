 Just need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90? My impression is that this was totally trued up...
 Is this some weird tranny charge?
 Ideas...
 As always, if you could go through these charges that would be great, and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month.
 Thanks,
 Bill
