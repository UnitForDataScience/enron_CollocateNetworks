 Brian, Janet, Chris:
 
 I spoke to Danny McWhirter of CPS this morning. He said he expects to have the RFP sent out first week of May. CPS has scheduled a May 10th meeting in Houston (probably at the Hyatt) for all invited bidders for Q&A meeting re: bids. He mentioned El Paso, Aquila and Duke. Danny is pushing for bids to be due on June 1.
 
 I am trying to get him to play golf with me when he comes, so we'll see! If any of you are interested, let me know.
