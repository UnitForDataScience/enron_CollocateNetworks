 Rob,
 After reviewing both Lauren's and Jeff's comments, I have little to add.  I 
 would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first 
 paragraph with "and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at 
 strategies for reducing CO2  emissions more broadly, in ways that make 
 economic and environmental sense" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol 
 directly.
 And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct 
 employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report 
 and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and 
 communicate their thoughts.
 Thanks,
 Catherine

 Hi Mr. Lay,
 
 I am a Specialist in Corp. PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal 
 eBiz publication.  I am working on a story about the recent issue with 
 respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to 
 President Bush's as well as the coal industry.  
 
 I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide 
 emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his 
 decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns 
 that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to 
 natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher 
 electricity prices causing problems similar to California.   
 
 I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees.  A 
 quote from you about this issue would be great.  I would also be interested 
 in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling 
 CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2.
 
 Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.  
 
 Thanks,
  Ann Schmidt
