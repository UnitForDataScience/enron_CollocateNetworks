 Dave-
 
 You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron 
 are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal, 
 commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain 
 these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading 
 desk to truly understand how ENA functions?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Joe Short
