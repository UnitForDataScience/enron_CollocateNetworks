 right now.  Also, it's 82XX we're talking about, not 83XX.  83XX is the bill 
 that Wright's authoring with the Rs.
 
 Also faxing to you Reliant's "Dear Dunn, Go to Hell, Sincerely, Reliant" 
 letter.
 
 Best,

 Vegas still sez best odds are on Edison going in.

 The games continue in California.  
 
 The date of suspension now being considered in 83xx is July 12.  We are still 
 working (1) to define this in a way that is favorable to getting our recent 
 DASR group authorized for DA service or (2) supporting some other solution.
 
 Will keep everyone informed as information comes in.  
 
 By the way, I've asked Evan Hughes for a detailed listing of how moving the 
 date impacts our success ratio.

 support the bill (though we are supporting 
 it behind the scenes).
 
 What people don't know:
 Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by 
 Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his 
 signature. 
 Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the 
 Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not 
 postpone).
 Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature 
 will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to 
 postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on 
 the energy legislation at the same time.
 
 Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not 
 get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 Sacramento is one goofy place.
