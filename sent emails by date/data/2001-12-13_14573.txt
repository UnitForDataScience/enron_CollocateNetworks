 As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).  
  
 Here is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.
  
 I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs  but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.
  
 I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  Will the assistance service help me at customs?  Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?
  
 Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.
