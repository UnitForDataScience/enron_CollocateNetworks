 Origination.

 Edith Cross and I looked at the Fort James deal in great detail in early 
 1999.  When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money 
 position and an offsetting expense of about $11 million.  This money has 
 already liquidated from our book.  In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR 
 that reflects this liquidation.  At that time, west power trading also paid a 
 350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in 
 origination.  
 
 I have also heard about a "partnership" fee that Enron paid to Fort James 
 around the same time.  I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from 
 it.  It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.
 
 On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.  
 Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.  I think that someone needs to 
 look at the actual journal entries from March of 1997 to see why an expense 
 of $11 million was deferred.
 
 This is not my problem.  I should not receive this expense.  Until this is 
 resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred 
 account does not hit west power trading's expenses.
