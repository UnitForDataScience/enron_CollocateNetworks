 on an approach.  I have a call in to him on another transaction, so I'll 
 ask.  Are you in Houston today?

 Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration 
 and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement?  I got a call from 
 the owner of Certosa Holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those 
 legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this 
 agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell 
 them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy 
 Milligan. AEW's assistant to locate the Shutts & Bowen invoice.  
 
 I understand we have engaged Shutts & Bowen in Tallahassee to review some 
 property tax issue.  Cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet 
 hard cost thang?

 Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
 I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
 Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
 Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
 necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.
 

 

 
 If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
 good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
 you.
 
 Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
 the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
 the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.
