 jurisdiction.  As for the arbitration forum, my preference would be a major 
 regional metro area TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would prefer 
 including a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor in 
 Tennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).   
 They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.  We both 
 agreed to reconsider this.  Richard:  What do you think about that?
 
 Any comments are welcome.
 
 Regards,
 Janice
