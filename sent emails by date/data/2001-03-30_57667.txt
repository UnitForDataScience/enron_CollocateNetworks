 be a fit for my organization or EES.  Unfortunately, I am heading out of town 
 with my family on the 12th (unfortunate for meeting with Ira , not 
 unfortunate for me) and EES has new leadership who is trying to assess the 
 state of things before making new senior level hires.  So, let's wait a bit.  
 Thanks

 the introductions. PLS let me know that this is ok.
