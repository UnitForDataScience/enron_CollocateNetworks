 supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.
 
 I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.
 
 Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?

 The deal ticket has 2001 on it not 2000. Can you find out who they sold the 
 gas to. Do you need this pathed and tracked and balanced? - Rob

 Robert/Victor,
 
 Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
 from Mark Feldman from Volume)...
 
 
 Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
 is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
 deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
 of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
 Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
 booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.
