
 
 Please read the proposal below from an excellent ghost writer and 
 presentation consultant from the White House Writers Group.  Steve Kean 
 suggested looking into this for some fresh ideas to improve our presentations.
 
 We can have a session where we share with them some of our presentations and 
 they give us ideas for humor and personalization.  A question is whether this 
 would work for internal audiences such as all-employee meetings as well as 
 external ones.  Once we understand their methodology and capabilities, we 
 might find we can do some of this ourselves, and we would consult with them 
 on an as-needed basis for future presentations.
 
 If you are interested in this seminar, let me know if you have a presentation 
 that they could review to make suggestions with and pick a possible date for 
 a seminar
