 Hi guys,
 
 Could you please go through all your books and see if there are any ECC deals 
 in them for April or May settlements.  I've gone through a few and here are 
 some deals that need to be flipped before noon tomorrow at the latest as I 
 need to invoice them tomorrow.
 
 FT-EAST
 
 
 
 G-DAILY-EST
 
 
 
 GD-CENTRAL
 
 
 
 Please make sure that all these deals are flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book 
 before noon Houston time on May first.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
 
 Thanks
 Stacey
