 sign on Friday.  
 
 
 When do you want to talk?

 Kay:
 
 I'd like to talk through the points below so I can make sure I understand the 
 issues. By the way, I did not agree to anything with Michael, in fact I told 
 him it was easier to not include any change order provisions. Have they asked 
 for an extension yet?
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben
