 claim against any insurance company. Anyone else? If so, please contact 
 Michelle.
 
 

 

  
 
 
 Not when I was there, but I wasn't there the whole time.

 Michelle and Ken,
 
 were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday? If
 you
 got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give
 me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position
 clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.
 
 Justin
