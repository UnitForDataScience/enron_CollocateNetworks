 The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
 that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
 Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
 what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
 you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
 the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
 during this time period.
 
 I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.
