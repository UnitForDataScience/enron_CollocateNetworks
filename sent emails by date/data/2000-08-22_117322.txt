 Alan-
 
 Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based 
 on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for 
 The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M:
 
 ISDA Schedule,
 CSA and
 Enron Corp. Guarantee.
 
 The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.  
 It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other 
 counterparties
 such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note 
 that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.
 
 Please note:
 
 1.  There are still a number of "options" in the documents which I have not 
 completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in 
 square
 brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;
 
 2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully 
 checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in 
 the documents;
 
 3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that 
 appropriate counsel reviews same;and
 
 4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for 
 a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in
 Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Best regards,
 
 John
