 do.  I know also from some recent discussions with Rick (who has also had a 
 fair amount of contact with Jose) that he has very positive views on Jose's 
 work.  I think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have 
 a good discussion about Jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked.

 John.
 
 1) I am attaching a power point file of the key issues we are following in 
 the regulatory group as of now. I highlighted a few to further discuss.  See 
 below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2) I am enclosing the descriptors for the items I highlighted.

 Jose:
 
 Jim Steffes, Gia Maisashvili and I  are helping Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean 
 prepare for their Executive Business Review with Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay on 
 this Wednesday, Oct 4th.  Some of the "success stories" that we want to 
 include have originated in your region, and we want to be sure that we have 
 the proper information on each of the listed activities.
 
 We need to talk today because of the time sensitivity involved here - I will 
 give you a call this morning.
 
 Thanks, Jose-
 
 John
