 y=20
 problem is that I am not certain that the IPE description is what we use=20
 (I'll defer to your verification) but it appears each monthly calculation=
 =20
 incorporates pricing from three different delivery month contracts.  Sara
 
 P.S.  I would like a copy of the Platt's marketwire if you can locate

 The mean of the arithmetic average of the daily high and low quotations for=

 Crude Oil Assessments published in the table entitled =01&Crude Price=20
 Assessments: International US$/BBL: Brent (DTD)=018 in the issue of Platt=
 =01,s=20
 Crude Oil Marketwire ("Platts") that reports prices effective for such=20
 Business  Days during the Calculation Period minus the average of the daily=
 =20
 settlement prices for the prompt month of the IPE Brent Futures Contract fo=
 r=20
 each Commodity Business Day for the applicable Calculation Period, with the=

 exception of the last Commodity Business Day of the prompt month on which d=

 the settlement price for the Second Nearby Month will be used.=20
 
 Common Pricing:
 
 Pricing to be effective only on the days when both the IPE is open and Plat=

 publish their dated Brent assessment.
