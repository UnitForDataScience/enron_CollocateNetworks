 In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
 year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's 
 and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two 
 most recent and very illustrious predecessors.  Given your meteoric career 
 tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
 accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.
