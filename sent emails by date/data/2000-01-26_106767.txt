 paper" addressing tax issues for physical (power, gas and I don't know what 
 else) and financial trading in Argentina.  What phone call on Thursday were 
 you referring to on your voice mail?  I'll try to call you in about an hour.

 I think we should meet and make sure the three of us are on the same page in 
 terms of what our position is for this office.  Let me know what works for 
 the two of you.  I do not know if Lynn is interested in the issues the 
 commercial group has been raising lately other than his advice means that we 
 cannot transact from Argentina.
 Thanks
 Brent

 I would like to pursue with Marval.  Should we meet to discuss?  Sara
