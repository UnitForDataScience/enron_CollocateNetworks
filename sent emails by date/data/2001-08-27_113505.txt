 Janet,
 
 I placed a called into Pat in Reg. Affairs and he  is currently investigating this issue and the possible infractions to the Code of Conduct.  My experience in govt. affairs warrants full investigation..
 
 
 Will keep you posted

 I pulled up TXU Energy Services' website and did a little browsing. Do you think the retail energy services group is utilizing information re: customer accounts that the regulated utility has? i.e. consumption data, current pricing, etc? If so, isn't this illegal under the electricity Code of Conduct rules in Texas? If any end user in TU's territory could access that type of information through the retail website, I would think it would be a problem.
 
 Any thoughts?
