 Just to clarify, Enron's international business model and North American business model are quite different.   I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.   Enron NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.   We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.
 
 Enron's international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).   This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.
 
 I will let you conclude which business model is better.   I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a "free-market" model.
 
 Later.
