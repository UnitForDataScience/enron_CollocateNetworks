She is working on helping us establish the link between united technologies and calpeak as well as provide other info.  I will let you know what they come up with.
 
 Thanks for your quick responses!

 Kim -
 
 A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:
 
 1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  
 
 2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.
 
 3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.
 
 Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?
