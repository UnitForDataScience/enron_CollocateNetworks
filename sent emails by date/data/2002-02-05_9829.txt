 Vladimir,
  
 Which measure are we going to be using at UBS?  VaR on portfolio #2 dosn't make sense to me that adding gas short to same position as #1c. increases risk.  What's up with that?  Also, could you forward the results from Rob Benson's portfolio's to me?  Thanks,
  
 Fletch

 Vladi, we need to talk about the PJM/Gas correlations. Could you also give us a correlation matrix, all power markets and gas markets. Thanks
