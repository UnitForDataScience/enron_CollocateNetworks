 The questions are as follows:
 
 1.  Has Enron provided Ecogas with such coverage for its non-Enron board 
 members so far?
 2.  What is the general scope of such coverage?
 
 Ecogas is a stand-alone company.  Enron owns about 85 percent of its stock 
 and has three people on its Board.
 
 I hope that helps.
 
 Michelle

 OOps there were about 4 emails from Jim Bouillion that were forwarded to me 
 on this matter.  Apparently I picked up the wrong name.  It is Jerrel Branson 
 that is seeking coverage under Enron's D&O.  The same questions apply only 
 change the name to Jerrel Branson.    We just need to know the chain of 
 ownership to answer.  The Enron D&O policy is very broad.  
 
 Thanks and sorry for adding to the confusion on this coverage question.

 I'm not very experienced in these matters so I'm checking with the folks
 here.  Can you explain why Enron should cover non-Enron directors?  Why
 doesn't Ecogas have its own insurance?  Any help you can provide is
 appreciated.
