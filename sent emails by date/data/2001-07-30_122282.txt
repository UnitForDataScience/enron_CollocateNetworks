 Great, sorry, I didn't see the scroll bar.  Thanks!
 
 If you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza's, that would be great.  I believe Morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians, so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections.  I would order plenty for our hearty crowd, someone could always take the leftovers home and eat it for breakfast the next morning!
 
 Also, will the Mad Potter provide the wine, beer and soft drinks?  Is there anything else that you can think of?  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     When:	Wednesday, August 08, 2001 8:00 AM-7:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
 Where:	Four Seasons Hotel (Downtown)
 
 I will be there!
 
 Sasha,
 
 I did not see TK Lohman or Tracey Geaconne on the distribution list.  Would you please make sure they get an invite.  Also, would you copy Steve Harris on this invitation even though I know he will be out of town on this date.  
 
 Thanks for your help.  Kim.
