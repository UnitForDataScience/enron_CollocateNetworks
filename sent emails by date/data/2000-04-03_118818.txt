 Alan,
 
 Have you had a chance to review the EOL contracts that we will be using in 
 Japan for the rollout of the international petroleum products?  If not we 
 probably should take a look.  I would also like to have B&M review as well.  
 Pls send me a copy when you have this available.  We are shooting to have 
 products posted by the end of the month and an official rollout 10-12 May.
 
 While EOL should be ready to go, there could be some complications with FX 
 coming from Sydney, commodity prices from Singapore and even help desk 
 support from London.
 
 Let's talk about this early on this week.
 
 thanks,
 
 Joe
