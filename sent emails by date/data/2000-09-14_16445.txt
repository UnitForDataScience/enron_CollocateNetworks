 * In an effort to make our limited ticket distribution more equitable,
 tickets will be distributed by lottery.
 * You must register between Sept 13th and Sept 18th.
 * A lottery will then be conducted and ticket recipients notified by e-mail
 and able to purchase tickets.
 * For those unable to attend, we will have post-conference videocasting.
