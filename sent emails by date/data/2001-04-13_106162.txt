 I've left a message with Tracy Ngo (in Portland) and will let you know as 
 soon as I hear from her.  How long will you be in the office today?

 Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same 
 manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty 
 goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion 
 that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit 
 rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at least 
 BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

 Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
 3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
 have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side
 letter agreement."  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
 finalize by April 6.  Thanks.
