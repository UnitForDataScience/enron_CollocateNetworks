 at it.
 
 Rusty/Fred, I'm not sure of the context of the presentation of the 
 information.  Is this something which is going to the public, or to the 
 governmental entity involved?  If there is something which will be 
 distributed to the public, then we should consider having Enron's PR group 
 bless it.

  As many of you know, we have received a number of written questions
 from Livingston County which were presented to them by residents.  Enron and
 our firm have  prepared and  attached an initial draft response to those
 questions.  Copies are provided in Word Perfect and Word for your
 convenience.  Certain of the responses deal with specific areas for which
 each of you are responsible.  While we have attempted to utilize the
 information that you have previously prepared, it is critical that you
 approve the responses.  Please review the proposed responses and fax me any
 changes or call me by noon tomorrow.  While I'm quite interested in any
 comments you may have on any of the responses, please be prepare to
 specifically approve or modify the following questions:
 
  1. Pollina - Questions 1 - 7;
 
  2. Farnsworth & Wylie - Questions A and B;
 
  3. ENSR - Questions 8, 9, A and B; and
 
  4. Everyone else - Everything.
 
  I hope to speak to each of you, but if you cannot reach me please
 call Karen Way at 312-368-2152.
