 The October EPSC invoice showed the following floor space being billed incorrectly to 0366/111692:
 
 Room #		Should be billed to		Sq. ft	
 ECN 4106		0366/112476		547
 
 ECN 4751		0366/112476		314
 
 Also on their October invoice, there is an entry for rent correction for 1154 sq.ft. The ticket number is EBR10019310085, dated 10/17/01. I looked at all my rent corrections submitted, and it isn't one of mine. Could you please advise what rooms this correction covers?
 
 Thanks for your help.
