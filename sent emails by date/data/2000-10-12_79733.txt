 I am Mike's assistant and I believe you discussed this meeting with my clerk 
 when I was out of the office on Monday.  I am preparing Mike's calendar for 
 tomorrow and I would like to make sure that I have all the correct 
 information for him regarding the El Paso meeting.  Can you please provide 
 the exact details for the El Paso meeting?  In particular, will you be 
 meeting Mike at his office or does he need to meet you somewhere else?  At 
 what time does he need to meet you?
 
 Any specific information that you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  
 Thank you.

 I have set 10:30 as the meeting time.  Please place on Mike's calendar  The 
 meeting should go for 1.5 hours or so.  
 
 Thanks
 Eric Gonzales
