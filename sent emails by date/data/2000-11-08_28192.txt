 people would be in a good position to answer, so maybe start by finding out 
 if they are already responding, either through Lou or otherwise.  Then get 
 the right people to review and supplement this list.  Thanks. df 
 


  
  
 Lou,
 
 This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
 Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
 inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
 requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
 identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
 assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
 verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 Susan Worthen
