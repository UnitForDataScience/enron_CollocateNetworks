 months.  But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my 
 mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some 
 observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.
 
 OBSERVATIONIt seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of 
 getting fingered.
 
 In the best case, the clamoring for a "refund" subsides.  In which case, the 
 only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the 
 risks of getting fingered.
 In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by 
 the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of 
 California consumers.
