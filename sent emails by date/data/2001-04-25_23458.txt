   is a Tuesday  rather than a Friday.
  
 I look forward to your response (if you've not  already replied) to the two questions posed in my email yesterday:  (1) is  August 28 OK for our meeting?; and (2) do you approve Houston as the venue for  our 2002 Institute on Oil and Gas Law and Taxation?
  
 Thanks.
