 Nelson:
  
 We spoke to Enron's accounting dept who said that the invoice is still in their system because James Derrick (whom all the previous invoices have been sent) said that he is not the person to approve the payment. The accountant asked me whom he sould direct the invoice to. Please let me know your thoughts.
