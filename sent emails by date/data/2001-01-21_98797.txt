 David: Attached is a portion of the San Diego Superior Court webpage
 indicating new superior court filings. Padre Dam Municipal Water District,
 Valley Municipal Water District and the Sweetwater Authority filed suit
 against Enron and others for "antitrust/unfair business practices" on
 January 16, 2001. I will get a copy of the complaint so you can call me
 regarding specifics(I will not forward the complaint, thereby avoiding any
 argument that you have been "served"). I'll let you know when we obtain the
 complaint. Jeff and I will be ready to help if you need us, Mac
