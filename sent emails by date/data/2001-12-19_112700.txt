 Update:
 
 1.  GAS - All sales customers have been reviewed, and we believe the list is ready to go, pending a final review by Janet and Don.  All has been transmitted (copy attached) to Marshall Turner.  We are still lacking any SUPPLY contracts that need to be rejected, but should have it in the morning.
 
 2.  POWER -  All sales customers except for 6 have been identified.  We have transmitted (copy attached) all information with the exception of these 6 to Marshall Turner.  We work tomorrow on resolving the 6, and will provide the data to Marshall at that time.  Of course, these schedules are subject to a final review by Janet and Rogers.
 
 3.  NON-STANDARD DEALS - I do not have an update from last night, and per Marshall Turner, he has not received any additional schedules from Michelle since yesterday (Mondy, 12/17).  What is the status of this filing?
 
 
 As a reminder, I need the current support from each group for the analysis and reason for rejection.  As we agreed in the meeting this morning, Janet has asked that I be on point for gathering and retaining this.  Please forward me your matrices that suppor this rejection filing.
 
 Janet:  As Outlook was down most of today, I don't think anyone was able to get you the Power matrix.  I do not have the most current one, but I have attached the one as of last Friday to provide you the format.  
 
 Per discussion with Marshall this evening, the motion is being reviewed internally at Weil, Gotshal, and he will keep us posted tomorrow on filing status.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
