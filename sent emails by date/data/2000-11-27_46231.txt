 Thanks Tana - Cindy please could you put a Power of Attorney in place for 
 Jeff Kinneman to sign, say confidentiality agreements and letters of intent 
 (for now) on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited?
 Please let me know if you need more details.
 
 Many thanks
 
 Michael
 
 
 
 

 
  
 Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever 
 documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in 
 Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.  We don't know what it will 
 take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or 
 Mark Frevert to sign.
