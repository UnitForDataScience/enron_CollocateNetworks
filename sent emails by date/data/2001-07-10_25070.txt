 Sorry it took so long to get back to you. My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs. Lots of fun. I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation. Are you over your cold yet? It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July. I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th. I watched the NY fireworks on TV. We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest. Better get back but I'll write back later.

 Crystal,
 
 How was your trip? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat.
 We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better
 destination. Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the
 humidity. Can't wait. Take it easy.
 
 Chris
