 the meeting with a slide that is titled "Step One:  Shutting Your Sorry-Ass 
 Pipeline Down ONce and For All" .   Seriously, the agenda doesn't seem to 
 have any flavor of escalation, which is great given the  lack of attractive 
 alternatives for our team right now.  Talk to you about this tomorrow.  DF
