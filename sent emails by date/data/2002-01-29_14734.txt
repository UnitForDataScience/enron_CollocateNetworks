 I have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.
 
 Group's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think "Bug's Life").  The bible lessons are about David and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.  The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk  as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (Kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri. Feb 8  - if either of those days suit.
