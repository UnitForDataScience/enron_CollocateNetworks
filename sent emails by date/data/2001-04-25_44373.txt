  There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract 
 that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you 
 mean "preceding confirmations".  Confirmations are only done under trading 
 type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with 
 Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you 
 request changes to that deal.

 Dan,
 I am under the impression that this Master Physical Contract will supercede 
 any preceding confirmations.Please correct me if I am wrong.

 Hey Dan, Gary,
 
 Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
 an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
 I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
 is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
 the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
 of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
 needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.
 
 Thanks
 Russell

 Gary,
  Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
 worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
 Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
 work on the request.  
 
 
 
 
 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dan,
 Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I 
 bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know.
