 Dear Sally, 
 I should have and I could have made a better job of trying to sell my idea at 
 yesterday's meeting.   I'll be the first one to admit that all of my 
 suggestions are not always the best alternative but,   I hope that you 
 believe that I do have your best interests and Enron's best interests in mind 
 every time that I make a suggestion.   
 I hope to earn your trust as we continue to work together.
 Sincerely, hgm
