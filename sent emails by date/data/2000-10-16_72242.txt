 I would contact Kathy Clark.  As far as I know, there have been no change 
 orders (unless my memory is failing, which is a possibility!).

 Kay:  Do you know whether EE&CC has someone keeping watch over the ABB 
 transformer contract & associated change orders, and if so, who that might 
 be?  I need to get a good read on what CO number we are up to, etc.
 
 Hope things are well with you.
