 will work.
 I benefitted a great deal from what I heard from the group, especially 
 regarding the PRC.

 Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we 
 appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share 
 information. 
 
 You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again!
 
 Regards, - Roger
