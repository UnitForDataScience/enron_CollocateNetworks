 tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
 of transparent and standardized information.
 
 Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
 "problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
 bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
 and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
 deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
 incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
 addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
 a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
 tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
 power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
 development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.
 
 A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
 confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
 information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
 FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
 established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
 displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
 web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
 competition.
