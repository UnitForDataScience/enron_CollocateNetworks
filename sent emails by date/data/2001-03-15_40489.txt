 2.3     Delete last sentence.  If Enron is already in the queue (or 
 considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at 
 FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to 
 remain in the queue.  I don't think this is necessary and all are protected 
 because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue.
 
 4.3   Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost 
 unfortunately).  It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days.  PGE is 
 protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a 
 notification.
 
 6    ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these 
 changes for PGE.)
 
  6.1  Add after "as modified by the Commission" "if Customer chooses to 
 commence construction."
 6.2   Modify last sentence 



  
 Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be.
 As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power.
 
 Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT.
 
 Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Jay.
