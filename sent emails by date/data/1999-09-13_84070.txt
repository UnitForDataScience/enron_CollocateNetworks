 Gerald, you've been selected as United Way campaigner for Enron North 
 America's legal department.  For Enron's United Way campaign only, all of 
 legal is included in Corporate.  We'd really like to have you attend our 
 campaigner training session Monday.  See the details below and let me know if 
 you can make it.  If you can't attend, I will send you instructions on what 
 to do.  Mainly, it's distributing pledge cards to employees in your group and 
 following up to see if they've turned in their cards.  I look forward to 
 meeting you.
 
 Mary
  giving you helpful tips on 
 how to be a successful campaigner for Enron's United Way campaign.  We also 
 will answer any questions you might have.
 
 R.S.V.P. to Mary Clark by email or voicemail (3-7325) no later than Friday, 
 so we can give a headcount to Eatzi's.   We do apologize for the short 
 notice.  If you cannot attend, don't worry, we will send you the campaigner 
 training materials.  
 
 Thanks for your support.
