 Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
 transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
 well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

 Paul, 
 
 The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
 Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
 prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
 activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
 out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
 development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
 ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
 management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
 Sweden and Finland.
 
 Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
 extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
 of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
 entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
 anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?
