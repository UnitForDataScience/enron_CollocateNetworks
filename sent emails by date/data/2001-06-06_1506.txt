 The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)
 
 Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  "cleaner" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more "dirty" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  
 
 The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.
