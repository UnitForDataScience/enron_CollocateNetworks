 Hi,
 
 I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
 concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
 (from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
 she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
 transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
 presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
 gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
 issues she has with EOL.
 
 Tel: 44 20 7412 3190
 
 Regards,
 
 Debbie
