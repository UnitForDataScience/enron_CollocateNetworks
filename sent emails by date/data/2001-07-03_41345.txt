 Attached are clean and blackline drafts of the ISDA Master Agreement noting your changes to Parts 5(b)(g)-"Eligibility" and 5(p)-"Additional Definitions".  If the attached revisions are acceptable, we should be in a position to finalize execution documents.
 
 Did your lawyer have any comments to the guaranty forms?
 
 Thanks!
