 Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  
 
 For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:
 
 1. New Gen
 2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
 3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
 4. Coal- utility stockpiles
 
 Thanks,
 
 Robert Johnston
