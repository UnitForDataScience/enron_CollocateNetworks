 I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, specializing on
 statistics.  I have worked at Citizens Power (now Edison Mission Marketing
 and Trading) since April of this year developing software for their
 trading desk and risk management department.
 
 In particular, I have implemented state-of-the-art
 procedures to price derivative contracts on gas and electricity, and
 worked on default correlations among counterparties.
 
 Attached is a html copy of my vita.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Carlos J. Morales
