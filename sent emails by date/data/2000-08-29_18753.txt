 Good points.  Since Lara is on vacation this week, and Xi Xi is in Asia, 
 let's try to put a call together next week sometime.  Please email Tracy your 
 schedules or preferred times.  Thanks.

 Attached please find a chart that summarizes the differences between IXC and 
 CLEC obligations for Texas, New York and Illinois.  This project was meant to 
 incorporate California and Florida; however, I have not yet received any 
 information from our counsel in CA and I only received the pertinent 
 information from our counsel in Florida late last night and this morning.  I 
 apologize that I was not able to include any information from those states.  
 I will incorporate their information when I return from vacation.
 
 I have asked Gloria to provide some of you with copies of the material that I 
 received from Florida  to utilize in my absence (e.g., Sue, Donald, Scott).  
 You should already have the material from TX, IL and NY.  
 
 Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns.  Thank you.
 
 Regards,
 
 Lara
