 Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be

 Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more "classes" for his staff from

 AEP one venue to make good on that statement.

 This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these 
 companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.
