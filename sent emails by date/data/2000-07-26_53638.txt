 Vince, as I mentioned, attached  please find an overview memo on the PoolMod 
 model. We would like to invite your group to attend a meeting with the people 
 from London Economics (tentatively Thursday noon) to discuss the benefits of 
 using this model to predict pool prices in Colombia
 
 
 Thanks, Maria Elena
