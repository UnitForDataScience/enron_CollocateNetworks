 I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.
 
 1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation 
 equation and
 the way it's typically discretized.
 
 2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain 
 what CT is (perhaps a footnote).
 
 
 I am also including a message I sent to Julie today.
 
 
 
 Best regards.
 
 Vince
 
 
 
 




  
 
 Hi Vince,
 
 I'm wondering if you got this last week? If you could have a quick look and
 get back to me with any comments that would be great - Robin is chasing me
 on this one!
 
 Best regards.
 
 Chris.
