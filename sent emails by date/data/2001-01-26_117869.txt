 of computer virus activity since November.

 Before sending this (or the "No Cure for this Virus") to anyone else, let me
 check it out.
 
 I'm suspect of any email - even a warning - that recommends you send it to
 absolutely everyone you know.  I've forwarded it to one place, the
 anti-virus people here at work.  If they're real (the viruses that is), the
 tech'ies will know about them, or will know who to ask.
 
 Hope all is well with everyone.
