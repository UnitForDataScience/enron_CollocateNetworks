 more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was 
 stronger.  Thanks.

 Before I send out the memo for March, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
 that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
 10 curves that were validated for March.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
 look at are:
 
 NGI-MALIN
 NGI-PGE CG
 IF-CIG WIC
 
 The shifts in MALIN and PGE CG are pretty clear.  For CIG WIC, please note 
 how the front years show a price drop compared to prior months, while marks 
 in the mid-years have shifted upward by approximately  $0.10.  Thanks for 
 your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.
