 Patty Grutzmacher and Jennifer Stevenson (both Andersen) were scheduled to review our pricing model with Tom Bauer (Andersen partner) this week.  Due to issues relating to the Enron shareholders' lawsuit,  Tom could not meet with them.   Patty and Jennifer did have further discussions with Amitava and Vasant.   They are all right with the model.
  
 Larry - 
 Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Director of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk.  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me know.
  
 Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push the issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.  We are still anticipating a resolution this quarter.   I will continue to keep you informed.
