 I got the pictures yesterday.  They looked great and were very clear.  I am 
 interested in buying a Bonnard and am ready to make a decision on the one you 
 have as well.  I will send you a check via overnight mail if we can come to 
 an agreement.  What is your best and final total  price for the work?  I will 
 make a yes or no answer upon my receipt of your email. 
 
 Thanks,
 Mike 
 
 
  PS -  I am going to pass on the Braque and Picasso for now.
 
 
 
 
 
 


   
 Dear Mike:
 Please let me know that the photos arrived.
 Thanks,
 Chris
