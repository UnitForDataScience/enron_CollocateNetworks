 Lucinda really doesn't know Carol all that well, so I think I'd skip her.  
 Holly's work # is (281) 364-5207.

 P.S.  I thought about asking Holly and Lucinda, but didn't know if they
 would be interested or not because of most of the people being the running
 group.  I would love it if they came.  Would you like to invite them, or, if
 you will give me their numbers, I would be glad to invite them.
 
 Thank you.
