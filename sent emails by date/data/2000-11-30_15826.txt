 Here's what one CallWave customer had to say . . . .
 
      "I have no computer training whatsoever, and I didn't want to
      have a second phone line installed. But, I really need a way
      for my family to reach me while I'm on-line. Callwave has
      completely taken away any worries. I was so impressed with
      the ease of downloading and installing CallWave!"
