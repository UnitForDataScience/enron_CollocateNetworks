 1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
 2.	ERCOT ISO Information
 	QSE
 	LSE
 	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
 	Other
 3.	APX Agreement?
 4.	Other
 
 Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.
 
 Thanks,
