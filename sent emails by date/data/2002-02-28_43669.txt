 I wanted to get your thoughts on service conditions that we're discussing with prospective Sun Devil shippers.
 
 Hourly swings.  We've indicated that the shippers can nominate 1/16th of their MaxDQ at delivery points in any hour subject to-
 - Proper notice
 - 24 hour ratable nominations at receipt points
 - no obligation on the pipeline to deliver more than the MaxDQ in any gas day
 
 Pressure guarantee.  All prospective shippers are power generators and they want pressure guarantees in the range of 500-600 psig.
