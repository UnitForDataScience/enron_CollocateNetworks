 Britt,
 Thank you for visiting with Wade and I yesterday.  Please find attached the
 revised Charter Letter.  The additions we discussed are in paragraph two.
 Please feel free to revise the document.
 
 PowerBrief wants Enron to be a Charter member and will do whatever it takes
 to make this a successful venture for you and your company.
 
 If you have any questions or comments, please contact me.  We appreciate
 your consideration and time.
 
 Jana
