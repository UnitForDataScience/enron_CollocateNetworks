 Sorry for the delay in responding to your request for updates to the
 information that OPG provided through the IMO's Transitional Information
 Team process. After considering the merits of your request, and in the
 interests of fostering continued good relations, we have decided to update
 the Transitional Team information with relevant year 2000 data.
 
 In order to be fair to all market participants, we propose giving the
 updated information to the IMO and asking them to update their Website. We
 have approached the IMO in this regard and the preliminary indications are
 that they are willing to do this.
 
 As you recall the Transition Information Team process resulted in the
 release of approximately 43 different types of reports (I have attached a
 list of these reports below). Generally, the reports fall into four
 categories: (1) reports produced by the IMO released with our consent or the
 consent of other parties as appropriate (i.e. Hydro One), (2)
 information/reports produced by OPG, (3) information/ reports produced by
 others, (4) one-off information items that would not be updated. In terms of
 the specific information to be released,  I have highlighted in gray on the
 attached chart the reports that we are planning on releasing and the reports
 that we will work with the IMO to get released.
 
 We are currently working with people inside the company and the IMO to
 gather the information needed for the proposed information release. I will
 advise you shortly on how this is progressing. Please call if you wish to
 discuss.
