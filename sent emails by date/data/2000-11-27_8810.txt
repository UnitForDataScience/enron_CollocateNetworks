 initial send.  Here it is...
  initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
 direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
 Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
 attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  
 
 Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
 year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
 year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
 Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
 make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

 I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
 checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
 which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
 calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?
