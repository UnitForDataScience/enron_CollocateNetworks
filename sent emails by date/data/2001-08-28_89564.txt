 If you can do all that , you can beat KSU.  I think NU can beat everyone but OU.  CU will be tough at Boulder no matter what.  Its like UT playing the aggies.  They get up for it.  Also ISU will give us a game.  If our D is attacking and we have a pass rush.  We could be in the Title Game to play OU again.
