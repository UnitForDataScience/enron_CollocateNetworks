 My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
 parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
 energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
 was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
 small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
 continue the service.
 
 
 Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
 nummber is 832-851-2806.
 
 
 Thanks
 
 
 Greg Schockling
