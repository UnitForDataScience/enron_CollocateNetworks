 didn't have time to analyze your paper, please see the attached paper on the 
 release of information in an RTO.  Also, talk to Alan, I think he provided 
 further support for our recommendations in an affidavit he filed at FERC.  
 Also, please work with Alan about your comments on page 5.  Alan, if you 
 respond through E-mails please copy me.  Thanks.
