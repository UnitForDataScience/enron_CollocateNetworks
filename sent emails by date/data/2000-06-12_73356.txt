 If these contracts are going to be assigned immediately to Mitsui, isn't the 
 issue of a guaranty a Mitsui issue? Is this addressed in the EPC contracts?
 
 If an Enron entity must give a guaranty, I would think we would want ENA to 
 give it, to be replaced by a Mitsui guaranty unless we have some safeguard 
 against the possibility of paying Mitsui and Mitsui not paying GE, so that we 
 would have to pay twice.

 Please review and comment.  Kay's comments are included and do not look
 unreasonable.  Jeff please edit this document and send back to Kay and I to
 see
 what you are thinking about in the clause that used to be 11, now 10, I
 think.
