 collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
 Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
 to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
 have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
 comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
 have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
 with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.
