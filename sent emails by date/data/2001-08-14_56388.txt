 It makes sense to invite somebody from EIM (Ray Bowen?) to the luncheon.
 
 By the way, what is the location?

 Michele,
 
 Vince mentioned that Tom Piazzi and a Wharton group is in the Enron building this week, discussing executive education and other Wharton products.  There is a lunch on Wednesday that Christy Patrick is arranging to which Vince suggested we go.  I am out on Wednesday and Thursday.  Are you available?
