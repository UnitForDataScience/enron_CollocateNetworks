 "The people of Edison are committed to pursuing the benefits of negotiated 
 practical solutions to California's energy crisis," said Frank. "The QF 
 agreement and the MOU, if approved, are critical steps toward resolving the 
 crisis. A bankruptcy, in contrast, would lead to years of delay and 
 uncertainty for our customers and raise serious questions about the business 
 climate in California."
