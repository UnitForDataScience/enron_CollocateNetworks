 Got your voice mail, and it reminded me to sent this out.  I don't know what 
 is up with Jeff, so why wait to send this?
 
 Next comes Finance/M&A (Lance and Travis).
 
 I'm having lunch with Dan today - want to join us?  We are going to Fox Diner.

 Kay, as we've discussed before, I'm interested in pursuing the opportunities 
 available in the ENA legal group.  As you know, my experience at EECC in 
 addition to focusing on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture 
 agreements, has also included cross-border financing agreements and merger 
 and acquisition activity.  Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked 
 with a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on 
 transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions 
 involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's 
 electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, 
 I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in DC where I focused on 
 general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business 
 entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and 
 securities offerings.  Thanks for your help.
