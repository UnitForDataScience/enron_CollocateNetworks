 about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
 300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
 in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
 basically tolling agreementsENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
 but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  
 
 Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
 guys.  Thanks.  DF
