 > EnronOnline.  What you might be interested in is what we are currently
 > evaluating in regards to the commercial efforts around EOL.  Several
 > of our customers have indicated an interest in setting up their own
 > enterprise solution while maintaining the ability to interact with the
 > major market sites.  This would require commercializing the EOL
 > platform.  Additionally, we have received some interest in the same
 > customers posting their own products on EnronOnline.  We are
 > evaluating both.  We are also evaluating the potential of Enron
 > leveraging our own EnronOnline support staff for a third party market,
 > thereby reducing the upfront infrastructure cost.  I know you are
 > working on the development of futures contracts but don't know what
 > your business goals are regarding the commodity products as they might
 > apply to a market like Enron's.  I will be out of the office Thursday
 > and Friday, but would enjoy discussing where we might be able to work
 > together if you have time next week.
