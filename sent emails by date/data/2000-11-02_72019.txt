 This is the recommended verbiage to address area classification issues:
 
 The electrical system design and installation shall be in compliance with the 
 requirement of NFPA 70 (NEC), in particular, Article 500 with respect to 
 Hazardous Locations.  The classification of locations shall be as recommended 
 by API RP 500 (Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for 
 Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities.)  The design compliance 
 with the NFPA requirements shall be demonstated in a design review or HAZOP 
 review meeting which includes representatives of Enron North America in the 
 review process.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dom
