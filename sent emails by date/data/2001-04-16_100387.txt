 	Fri	The Fabulous Thunderbirds	Gruene Hall
 	Fri	Cory Morrow			Luckenbach Dance Hall
 
 	Sat	Reckless Kelly			Antone's
 	Sat	Lucinda Williams		Gruene Hall
 
 Just more food for thought.

  and I deinitely agree!  I have done about half of those
 things...  Not too bad for a spoiled brat.
 
 Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow?  I am coming in town tomorrow, but I
 bet I am going to miss you.
