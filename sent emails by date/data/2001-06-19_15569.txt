 Let's talk more to discuss the latest developments.  Glad to hear that it's 
 still moving along. I'm in town tonite.  
 
 You MUST keep this strictly confidential
     
 
 Met for 45 min w Suresh Raghavan to discuss DealBench (Enron's proprietary
 auction platform) and the potential for Perfect to provide complementary
 solutions to their customers through EnronOnline and beyond.  We agreed that
 the purpose of our discussions would not be to have him sponsor us to the
 Global Strategic Sourcing unit, but only to consider Perfect as a bus dev
 deal.  We would need to price ourselves as an ASP for them, but with the
 liquidity they have (supposedly like $1B per day traded through
 EnronOnline), this should be a no-brainer.
 Suresh is the Principal of DealBench, as well as a Director of Enron Net
 Works.  DealBench is one of many business units under the Enron Wholesale
 Services / Enron Net Works group, including EnronOnline, ClickPaper,
 MetalMarkets, and other wholesale marketplace services.  DealBench has 3
 primary offerings:
 * Auctioning/RFQ management
 * Deal Rooms with complex negotiations tools
 * Data Rooms  for sharing of secure documents such as CADs, blue prints, etc
 for M&A due diligence.
 
 We discussed the basic functionality and sophisticated math behind Perfect,
 and he felt that it was worth considering further as a complementary service
 offering for the DealBench platform.  He would like to arrange a demo for
 him and some of his managers for the end of June or early July.
