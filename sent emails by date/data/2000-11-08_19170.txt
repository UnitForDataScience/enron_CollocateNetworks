 FERC should be more prescriptive.  Can't wait for a new board, made of new 
 people, to act.  FERC needs to be more assertiveI told him that our 
 position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking.
 I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner.  
 He said that it sounds like a good idea.
 I told him about our message on price caps.  He said that he would stress 
 that price caps ought to be a temporary "fix," and should be removed just as 
 soon as the market is "functional."
 
 Steve: I told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel 
 tomorrow and talk more.
 
 Best,
