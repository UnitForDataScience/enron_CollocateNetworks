 Did you get a chance to discuss my ESOP rollover situation with your superiors.  I received an e-mail stating that the new Savings Plan is available early and I would like to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks,

 Hi, Ben.  When you receive the information regarding Tom Martin's ESOP changes, and whether or not the appropriate people have received the information, would you please send me some kind of notification?  Please also let me know if Tom is the person who needs to call and inquire about it, as you suggested may be the case since it is handled outside of Enron.
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Laura Vuittonet
