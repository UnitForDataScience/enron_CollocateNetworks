 Traci,
 
 I am really looking forward to my cooking class. My first one is this Saturday morning. I'm a little scared I am going to be the class screw up. Oh well, I won't know untill I try. I think I am going to Yoga on Wednesday but dinner on Friday would be great. Give me a shout or drop me an e-mail and let me know what time you want to eat and I'll make some reservations. Talk to you soon.
 
 Chris
  

    
 
 Traci,
 
 Great seeing you again and catching up. Be sure to give me a shout if you
 are coming to Calgary. Don't work too hard.
