 Attached is a draft of a proposed agenda for your consideration.  It has more 
 things in it than a simple agenda, but I thought it may make some sense to be 
 a little more inclusive in the "bullets" to make sure we cover as much as 
 possible, from the standpoint of understanding or at least being aware of all 
 of the moving parts in CA (CPUC, FERC, court litigations, etc.), while we 
 have everyone together at this kick off meeting.  I would view the primary 
 purpose of the meeting to obtain as much factual information as possible and 
 to provide everyone with a general sense of the types of the considerations 
 that would be likely to come up in the bankruptcy context.
 
 I am simultaneously sending this to our bankruptcy folks so I may have some 
 additional comments or topics in the morning.  I also will send to you at 
 that time a brief memo prepared by our bankruptcy lawyers that goes through 
 some of the initial bankruptcy considerations, based upon our conversations 
 on Friday.
 
 Please call me when you wish to follow up.
 
 John
