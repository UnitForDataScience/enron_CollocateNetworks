 Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
 daily:
 
 CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
 CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
 intra-month curve at.
 TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10
 
 Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
 day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
 derived curves.
 If you have any questions please let me know.
