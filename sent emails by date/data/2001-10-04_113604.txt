 Question: Who in our group deals with the interfaces between Wholesale Competition (E.g. RTO, SPP) and Retail Competition?
 
 I am asking because Jean Ryall called me asking about our involvement in an upcoming PUC hearing (this coming Friday), where some SPP members have filed a petition requesting further delays in retail competition in light of the ongong discussions on RTOs.
 
 I asked Jean to send more information. There is nothing on the SPP website alluding to this hearing. Do you know anything about it?
 
 Tks
