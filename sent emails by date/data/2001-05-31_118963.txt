 eren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global bo=
 ok balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to g=
 et this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the grou=
 p who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost mo=
 mentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the di=
 rection of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott =
 advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still=
  cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as=
  well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we=
  both follow now.
 
 I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to =
 pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the =
 buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the fre=
 ight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explai=
 ning worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.
