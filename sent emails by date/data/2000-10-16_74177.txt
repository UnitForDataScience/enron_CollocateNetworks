 Kay, Fred, and Rusty:
 
 Attached hereto please find the Draft Option to purchase for the
 Titan-Schaeffer acquisition in Livingston County, Illinois for your review.
 Per Rusty's and my conversation,  the option has 1) a $4000 option payment
 for an 18 month term; 2) a $4000 renewal payment for an additional 18 month
 term; 3) farm tenancy provisions to allow the Optionor to continue to farm
 the land.  Please note we need to order preliminary title on the property to
 confirm if the property is held solely by Mr. Schaeffer or if his wife or
 other is also a fee holder.  Additionally, on page 7, please let me know
 what cap, if any, we are willing to place on reimbursement for soil
 preparation costs (we allowed $25 per acre on the Konicek option).  Please
 feel free to call me with any questions or comments.  Thanks and talk with
 you shortly.
