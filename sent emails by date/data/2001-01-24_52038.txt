 This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya
 identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies
 but the rest is in the Winston's hands.
 
 Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first
 approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on 
 Tanya's
 report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very 
 mechanical
 implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to 
 optimize it.
 
 Let's keep paddling along.

 Steve,
 - we spent about 5 fruitful hours with Winston last week.
 - I pretty much understand the data flow when the code runs.
 - I also got an idea where the time is spent during the execution of the code 
 by questioning Winston.
 I did not see any results of profiling the code. Winston's opinion is (as I 
 understood) that he knows how much time is spent 
 on different calculations and profiling is not easy to do, so we don't need 
 to do it. 
 - Based on above I suggested possible way to reduce the time credit model 
 takes to run and we discussed it with Debbie, who was
 going to arrange a meeting with Winston.
 - It might be useful to look at the Documentation created by contractors, if 
 you have it handy - send it to me, please.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Tanya.
 
 
 


   
 Tanya,
 
 how's it going with code-review from your perspective?
 
 ...did you manage to talk to our Documentation contractors?
 
 ...if not, would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as 
 it currently stands?
 
 regards
 
 Steve
