 David, 
 
 I've been forwarded a voicemail on Friday from David Haug where he has 
 requested that we include CALME's JV employees and Consultants who are at the 
 VP level. (He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).  
 Monica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only 
 AIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's 
 instance I'm reverting to you for a decision. 
 
 Although I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is 
 primarily with the Consultants.
 
 Below are my concerns in accommodating this request:-
 
 - The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has 
 finished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the 
 system message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In 
 this instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to 
 communicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give 
 feedback.
 
 - The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees 
 in order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to 
 describe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality 
 issues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.
 
 Call me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail, 
 
 K2
