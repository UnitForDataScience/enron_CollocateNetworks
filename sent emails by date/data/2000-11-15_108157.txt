 Dwight/Jason-
 
 We have done some analysis on the Brent / WTI spread- we would recommend
 buying WTI/ selling Brent for 2Q01 (as well as 02 and 03).
 
 We looked back to 1995 to see how each 2Q of these years traded 1 year
 prior to it being prompt.  The graph attached gives the raw data and the
 word doc some risk/ reward analysis (1995 was a weird year).
 
 (See attached file: Brent_TI Analysis.xls)(See attached file:
 Brent_WTI-Trade.doc)
 
 The spread is pretty constant at 1.25- 1.40 up until the contracts are
 prompt- then the average is more like 1.80.  2000 was particularly striking
 because of the gasoline shortage in the Mid West which put pressure on WTI
 at Cushing (and in general kept cracks high)- we got out to 2.70.  We are
 looking for a repeat this year.  The Arb has generally moved to 2.70
 minimum (to bring Brent to Cushing) because of higher freight rates this
 year- this looks to continue.
 
 The spread has moved out the last few days as Dec Brent is getting tight
 (due to UK tax affect)- now 1.52 at 1.57
 
 Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
