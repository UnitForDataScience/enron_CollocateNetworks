  The region's gas utilities reached a new record sendout of gas on
 January 17, 2000, reaching 3.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a 13%
 increase over the previous record.
 "Over the past year," said Degen, "the New England natural gas industry
 installed more new miles of pipelines than it has in decades. Whole areas
 of New England are gaining access to gas for the first time, and the rest
 of the region is receiving substantial new supplies as well."
 The Conference was attended by more than 300 industry and government
 officials. In his keynote address, Gary L. Neale, chairman, president and
 CEO of NiSource, Inc., and chairman of the American Gas Association
 (A.G.A.), reported on the national natural gas market projections found in
 A.G.A.'s recent study, "Fueling the Future." Neale noted that increased
 natural gas demand has multiple national benefits, including:
 environmental, energy security, trade, and economic development.
 NEGA, based in Needham, Massachusetts, was established in 1926. Its
 membership includes all of New England's local natural gas utilities, the
 interstate pipeline companies, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, and
 over 280 associate member companies. The natural gas utilities serve over
 2.2 million customers in 490 communities in New England.
