 My contacts have not been able to confirm that a meeting will take place 
 between Bush and Chavez.  They suspect the confusion stems from Bush's 
 scheduled participation in the Summitt of the Americas to be held April 20-22 
 in Quebec.  The Summit may address the FTAA (Free Trade Agreement of the 
 Americas) and will provide an excellent opportunity  to raise LNG issues. 
 
 Enron is putting together a hit list of issues that we should raise at this 
 meeting and we should add LNG, especially given th eimposrtance of LNG to the 
 US gas supply position.
 
 As I wander the halls of Congress talking about energy, it would be very 
 useful to have talking points on our LNG projects and the overall prospects 
 for LNG imports.  I do not want confidential information, but it would be 
 great if I cann state that LNG imposrts would be less than current spot 
 prices.  Can you put together some talking points for me please?
