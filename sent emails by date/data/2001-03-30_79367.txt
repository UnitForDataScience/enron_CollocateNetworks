 Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods.  He worked for me in 2 
 areas,  including directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left 
 enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.  He was 
 an associate at the time.  He is interested in coming back and is talking 
 with many areas of enron for positions.  His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in 
 Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.  If she does, he would 
 really like to come as well - if it is possible.  I didn't know if you have a 
 need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an 
 origination type of role.  
 
 I wanted you to have shot at him as well.
 
 Mike
