 There is a place in the agreement for a contract number.  I think we ought to 
 use the same contract number as before, but add a distinguishing number or 
 letter- like FV or LVCG.  How does that sound?

 Gentlemen,
 
 Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since 
 we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this 
 as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we need 
 the site specific stuff for this project.
