 last part...if you really wanted to go somewhere by yourself, I know you 
 would come back.  And I would miss you while you were gone!  I cannot imagine 
 wanting to go on a trip without you, and I don't consider myself a 
 "wanderer," either.  
 
 
 
 
 
 


  
  
 
 How true do you think this is?
 
 
 or remain at home.
