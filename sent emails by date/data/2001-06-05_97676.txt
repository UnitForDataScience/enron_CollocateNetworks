 FYI.
 
 
 WE REGRET TO ADVISE THAT VESSEL GROUNDED AT SAMSOE BELT IN POSITION
 N 55 DEG 53,9 MIN, E 10 DEG 56,5 AT 11:45 HRS TODAY.
 
 WE HAVE INFORMED NORWEGIAN AND DANISH AUTHORITIES.  THERE IS NO
 SPILL FROM THE VESSEL AND SHE IS NOT TAKING WATER.
 
 THE BOTTOM WHERE SHE GROUNDED IS OF SAND/MUD, AND WE WILL TRY TO
 GET HER AFLOAT AGAIN AT HIGH WATER, 19:27 HRS TONIGHT.
 WE HAVE CONTACTED TUG COMPANIES AND EXPECT A TUG TO ARRIVE THIS
 EVENING.  THE WIND/SEA IS CALM IN THE AREA.
 
 WE MAY HAVE TO TRANSFER SOME OF THE CARGO TO ANOTHER VESSEL
 IN ORDER TO GET BRAGE PACIFIC AFLOAT, BUT THIS WILL ONLY BE KNOWN
 TONIGHT.
 
 WE WILL REVERT WITH MORE INFORMATION TOMORROW AM.
