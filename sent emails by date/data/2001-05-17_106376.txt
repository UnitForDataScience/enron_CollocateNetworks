
 
 Bill and Tanya:
 
 I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year 
 deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit 
 Authority).  I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as 
 possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master 
 Agreement with MARTA.  We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001.  
 Until we resolve the "capacity" or "authority" issue, there is significant 
 legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.
 
 I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.
