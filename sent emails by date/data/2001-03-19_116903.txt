 Could you possibly help me set a shortcut to test this report today. I 
 believe what Kroum is asking is for me to run the STAGE report against 
 PRODUCTION data. Does that sound correct? I thought you'd know more. Just 
 holler over here whenever you get a chance.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
 order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
 when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
 report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
 Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate Symes
