 customers to another company.

 FYI,
 
 I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
 not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
 book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong 
 feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick 
 agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris 
 said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.
