 Hey John. Have you worked out the green card issues with the TXU options 
 trader? What's the status and timeline for getting him here? Also, Bruce 
 Sukaly will be talking with you about Steve Wang's option's background. I 
 think you should talk with Steve and decide whether he can fill some of our 
 voids from an option pricing/management standpoint. 
 
 Thanks.
