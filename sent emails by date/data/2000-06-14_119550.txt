 on the quantity of gas physically flowing out of each of the receipt basins
 for the period 1998 through June 8, 2000.  The data was taken from the VISA
 system (note the index numbers on the spreadsheet) and is presented
 graphically and as tabular values.
 
 The flow west on the southern system is shown as the sum of west flow
 through Pecos River and Waha stations less the east flow from Cornudas.
 This represents the net volume flowing west from Cornudas Station into the
 combined low and high pressure southern systems.  It eliminates the volumes
 moved east to Waha for delivery into the Texas intrastate pipelines at Waha.
