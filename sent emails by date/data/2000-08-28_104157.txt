 Here starts my comments on the contract language.
 
 5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
 fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
 Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.
 
 Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
 No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
 Oil futrures settlement prices
 
 Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:
 
 If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
 the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
 such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
 calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
 an amount equal to such excess.
 
 Thanks for you help.
