 Jeff  Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC 
 can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.  Am I missing 
 something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?  
 It's clear,however,  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates 
 can be changed.
