 Bob,
 
 Ricky is in the process of changing TAGG Deal Clearing to be able to combine 
 the deal leg
 containing the Nymex ( fixed )  price and the deal leg containing the Gas 
 Daily( float )  price onto one
 confirm.
 
 In order for this as well as the changes to the Settlement process  to work, 
 the following rules
 must be adhered to when the deal is captured.
 
 1) The fixed price must be entered as leg 1.
 2) The float price must be entered as leg 2.
 
 3) Leg 1 and leg 2 must be "linked" by clicking the "Link" button on the deal 
 capture
  window and by inserting a row as follows:
 
  
 
  The "Purpose" above will be listed as "Deal Link" when the picklist 
 displays.  The "Link" can be
  done from either leg 1 or leg 2.
 
  4) The  confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed  from leg 1.
 
  5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1.
 
  Please note that  any change to the status of either leg will be reflected 
 on the other
  leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,  the deal 
 status of both 
  legs will display "Generated".  Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal 
 Capture,
  the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to 
 "Pending -
  Revised after Generated".
