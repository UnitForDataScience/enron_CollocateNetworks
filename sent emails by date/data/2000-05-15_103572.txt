 this form.  The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em 
 (marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed 
 right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy 
 to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies 
 to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599.  
 Thanks for your help.  Sara

 Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about
 the
 guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format.
 Also,
 I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a "General Guarantee
 Agreememt" on
 behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade
 Resources
 Corp.) on January 28, 1998.  Which format are you interested in using?  Our
 cap
 for financial transactions with PG&E is, I believe, $10 million.  Please
 give me
 a call as I am the first point of contact for negotiating the guaranty.
 Thanks.
 Sara
