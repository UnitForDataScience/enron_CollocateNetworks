 I'm available today from 3:30 to 4:00 or 4:30 to 5:00 tomorrow if either of those works for you.

   I would suggest that we carve out the development with a slight ownership that has a put option (for the equity we retain) at a future date (but retain a percentage of the marketing arrangement for sale of excess power in the market).  I think NMC wants complete control based on their view of deregulation in Wisconsin.  I believe their long term strategy is to have a PPA with the above Utilities for the offtake (firm output w/ firm price) and the ability to market the excess (from both the Nuclear Units and peaking facility) at market rates. 
 
 This arrangement should be able to flange well with a financial insurance product (since the addition of the gas fired facility would provide more liquidity) that I have discussed with the Mid-Market Group (Terri Clynes and Doug Sewell).
 
 Let's arrange a time when we can discuss at your convenience.  Thanks, Ron.
