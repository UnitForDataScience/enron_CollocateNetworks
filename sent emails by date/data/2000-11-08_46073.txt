 find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a 
 Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power 
 Credit person to get me some headroom.  Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as 
 we speak!

 Brad,
 
 Here's another one.  They come in groups you know.  Hopefully, this will be 
 the last credit question for a bit.
 
 How is the credit part coming on this company's app?  The latest Access data 
 base entry appears to be October 23rd.
 
 Thanks,
 Griff
