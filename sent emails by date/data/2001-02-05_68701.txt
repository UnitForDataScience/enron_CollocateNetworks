 tagg numbers.  The sitara deal number involved is 543246.  Shout with any 
 questions.

 There was a typo for the gas volume that was used in Stacey's worksheet
 to calculate the gas price.  The original spreadsheet had 11,240 Dth/day
 and a gas price of $11.126/ Dth.  When you use the correct volume of
 22,263 Dth/day, the gas price drops to $5.6172 for Day 1 in the attached
 file.  This corrects the double-counting I told you about this morning. 
 
 The spreadheets you sent to me calculate the power keep whole expense
 on the "Gas Price" sheet.  On the sheet, it is the sum of $3,880,560 ( i.e. 
 the correct
 number if Day 31 is actualized rather than estimated by the power curves).
 
 Unfortunately, Stacey's calculation does not include the transport commodity
 savings, the tax expense and the amount of sharing due Sithe.  Those numbers
 were provided in my memo on Friday.  If we do one of these deals again, we 
 can provide Stacey with the additional expenses and revenues so that it can
 be perfect calculation.  
 
 Call me if there are any questions,
