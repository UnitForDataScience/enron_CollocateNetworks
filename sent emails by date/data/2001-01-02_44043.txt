  I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great 
 holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to 
 changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please 
 make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 
 10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to 
 me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.

 Mr. Hyvl,
 
 Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
 see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?
 (see message below)
 
 

 

  
 
 
 Christian,
      If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
 contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
 your address for Invoices.
