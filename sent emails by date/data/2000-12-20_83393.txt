 But, the volumes cited in the tickets prepared today were not consistent with 
 the volumes for which the East Desk originally provided price quotes based on 
 the volumes we cited on 10/26/00.  I have spoken with Scott Neal and he is 
 agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00 
 volumes rather than the 11/28/00 volumes.  Please, therefore, substitute the 
 Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks 
 much.
 
 I have prepared and attach herewith revised tickets.
