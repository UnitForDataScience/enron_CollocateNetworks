 Per our discussion yesterday Marty I've been asked to check on two issues
 regarding Enron.  First an attorney in our Philadelphia office has been asked
 to do some work for Wiser Oil Company as follows.  Wiser is acquiring the
 stock of a Canadian Corporation called Invasion Energy.  Enron Canada owns
 about 50% of the stock of Invasion.  Wiser has Canadian counsel who has asked
 us to work with them.  Enron Canada is represented by Bennett Jones LLP.
 Although we don't do any work for Enron Canada, I thought I needed to see if
 anyone at Enron had any problems with Reed Smith getting involved in this
 transaction as stated above.  I'm told an answer to this one ASAP would be
 nice.
 
 Second question is a little more confusing.  An attorney in our New York 
 office
 has been asked by a broker for Enron Global Services to get involved in
 negotiating a financial guarantee insurance agreement about providing
 insurance coverage for Winterthur International.  We would be representing
 Winterthur in the transaction.  I can get more information if needed.
 
 Thanks for checking on these Marty.  Let me know
