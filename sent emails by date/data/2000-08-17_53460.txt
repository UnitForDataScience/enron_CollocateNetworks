 Bobby,
 
 After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
 received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
 morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
 talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
 activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
 think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
 were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
 get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
 acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
 However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
 Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
 them on that point.
 
 David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
 gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
 access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
 walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
 found a beach.
 
 In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:
 
 Six year production plateau
 85% TOP
 $3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
 tail-end of the gas processing plant
 Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
 Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
 rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
 Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
 Trust Retention Account
 
 I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.
 
 Thanks,
 Doug
