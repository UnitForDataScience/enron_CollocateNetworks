 The South Central team would like to update you regarding our current statu=
 s with Ruthe and Jamie's departures:
 
 We understand you will be visiting with us regarding the changes within our=
  team with Ruthe and Jamie's departures.  With Ruthe and Jamie's resignatio=
 ns, our team is now comprised of nine schedulers and two accountants.  We a=
 re interested in learning if we will be allowed to fill at least one positi=
 on.  Ruthe has been such a valued team member and will be sorely missed  this amounts to approximate=
 ly five weeks annually each.  With the reassignment of their evenings along=
  with holiday/weekend coverage, we are basically looking at a rotation of o=
 nce every third weekend.
 
 In the interim, we understand Randy has provided a list to you with the sug=
 gested reassignments of Ruthe and Jamie's accounts.
 
 We are hopeful we will be allowed to fill this position on our team and we =
 look forward to visiting with you.
 
 Thank you,
 South Central=20
