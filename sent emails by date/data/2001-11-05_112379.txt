  November 2001Deficiency Auction
 
 
 An error has been found in the computation of the market-clearing price
 established
 for the November Deficiency Auction for UCAP purchased and sold in the New
 York
 City Locality.
 
 The NYISO has corrected the error and posted the revised results of the
 auction
 to its web-site.  Correcting the computational error revised the New York
 City Locality
 market-clearing price of UCAP for the month of November from $4.35/kW-month
 to
 $4.80/kW-month.
 
 Revised Award Notices will be sent to purchases and sellers of UCAP based
 on
 these revised results.
 
 For your convenience, the revised auction results are attached.
