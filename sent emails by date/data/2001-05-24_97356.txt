 I need all of the Foster applications on my local profile.  I have some of them on local and some of them on my terminal server profile.  I need the same Foster profile that Diana Scholtes has on her local machine.  As of this morning I still do not have it.  Please let me know when my profile gets updated.
 
 Thank You,
 Holden

 Hi Asem, just wondering if you've gotten any updates on the Foster Application issue for Holden Salisbury. 
 
 Thanks,  Chip
