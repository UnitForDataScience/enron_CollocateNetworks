 Calpine, but it is correctly booked as a physical forward sale at Malin.

 Darron,
 
 This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together  
 -  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ?

 Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was 
 originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not 
 yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into 
 Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the 
 master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08.
 
 Please reconfirm as necessary.
 
 Thanks all!
