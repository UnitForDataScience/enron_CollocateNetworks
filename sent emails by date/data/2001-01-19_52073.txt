 short and long run electricity.  I am really jacked up how our long run
 models are predicting the amount of capacity that can profitably be absorbed
 in ERCOT and where, the amount of capacity that can profitably be absosrbed
 in California and the WSCC and where, and where gas price basis is likely to
 go.  As you saw, our long run capacity addition technique is quite unique,
 and I have not yet introduced the long run electric and gas models broadly
 in the industry.  It is possible and realistic for Enron to get first mover
 advantage (or perhaps more) based on the results of the demonstration
 project we discussed.  Let's talk about that next week when we meet.
 
 If you could confirm one of the two suggested times via email or phone at
 650.218.3069 in the next day or two, that would be terrific.  I look forward
 to seeing you again and to working together.
 
 Also, I would like to get your advice regarding prospective investors in
 MarketPoint.  I am starting to get serious inquiries from large companies
 you know well who want to invest in MarketPoint as an equity paly, but I am
 very reluctant to consider such investments by organizations other than
 absolute, unequivocal industry leaders such as Enron.  I remember discussing
 this briefly with you, but I would like to get your input with the benefit
 of six more months thought if you would be willing when we meet.
 
 Thanks, and all the best.
