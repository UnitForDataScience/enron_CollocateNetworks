 we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
 boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
 drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride mountain,
 paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
 the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
 valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by far
 the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you
 checking any bags?
 
 

 
  
 
 
 What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I
 think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he
 is out of luck and on his own!
