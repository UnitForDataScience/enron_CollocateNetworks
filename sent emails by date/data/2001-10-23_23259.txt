 Dear Mr Lundstrom,
 
 from discussions with my partner, Sandeep Katwala, I understand that as the
 number of issues and proceedings arising out of the Dahbol project continue
 to proliferate we need to increase the partner resources devoted to the
 matter.
 
 I attach a short cv giving my professional and academic background. I have
 been at Linklaters for 16 years doing litigation and arbitration . For the
 last 2 years I have been co-ordinating L&A's European arbitration practice,
 but have, in the past, worked closely with Chris Walker. I have also had
 considerable exposure to power projects, both domestic and international
 (including an involvement in the Appeal to the Supreme Court in Pakistan on
 the Hub project).
 
 Last year I successfully completed a significant arbitration for EOG. Please
 feel free to call Barry Hunsaker at EOG if you would like more background on
 that job. I am presently acting on a much smaller matter for Enron (taking
 instructions from Stephen Wallace) that comes to hearing in London on 8/9
 November.
 
 I am presently based in Paris, but spend about one third of my time in our
 London office. This is increasing and, as a result, I will be moving back to
 London in July/August of next year. If you have any questions regarding my
 suitability to join the team on the Dahbol project please do not hesitate to
 call me direct.
 
 yours sincerely
