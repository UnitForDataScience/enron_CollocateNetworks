 That sounds good. Do you want me to see if Janet Greene and Midge can go?
 
 

 
  
 
 
 
 Pam:
 How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got
 about
 another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over
 with.  I
 hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.  Are you
 free
 for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up.  E-mail me
 back
 with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said
 hi.
