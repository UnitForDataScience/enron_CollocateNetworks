  In the meanwhile, credit annex meeting has been established for Nov.1 at the Marriott on Coronado Island.  Talk to you soon.

 As part of its efforts to assist the markets resolve certain issues arising
 out of this week's events, ISDA has been asked to consider the implications
 of certain continuing problems with futures exchanges and price source
 publications for commodity derivatives.
 
 Attached in the form of a draft statement from ISDA are a series of
 proposals that have been made by a number of institutions active in the OTC
 commodity derivatives area to resolve pricing difficulties.
 
 We welcome your comments on these proposals.  The purpose of this
 distribution is to encourage all participants in the markets for these
 products to consider the issues raised and, we hope, to come to some
 consensus position that can be reflected in a statement in the style of the
 attached draft by ISDA.  Please send any comments to Kimberly Summe

 
 Please contact me at ISDA at 212-332-1203 if you have any questions.

 General Counsel
