 I would think that at the least we would want you to attend the hearing.  I 
 also don't see any harm in you reviewing the data responses.

 The attached gives notice of what I believe would be a scheduling (status)
 conference for the Master Sales approval proceedings. This is the first
 information I've received about these matters since receiving the data
 requests a couple of weeks ago. Let me know how active you would like me to
 be in these matters. Shoud I request that Jerry Fox circulate drafts of the
 data responses? are you being kept up to date by Peoples on communications
 with staff? Should I plan to attend the hearing?
