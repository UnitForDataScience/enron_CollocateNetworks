 years
 (Published July 24, 2001) 
 The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more 
 intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee 
 sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn 
 over internal documents. 
 Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has 
 adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple 
 investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has 
 become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians. 
 At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted 
 criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love 
 to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a 
 tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With 
 less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based 
 companies as price gougers  to release all of the Duke-related documents 
 that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation. 
 Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary. 
 Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help 
 in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said 
 he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides. 
 The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes 
 will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at 
 least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their 
 utility bill checks.
