 Thanks,

  we're getting them 
 from the Structuring group.
 
 The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market 
 quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.
 
 I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol McLaughlin
