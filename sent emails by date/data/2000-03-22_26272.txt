 Stephanie,
 
 The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly 
 in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas 
 from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal 
 for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to 
 make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I 
 emailed Daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but I 
 am not sure who actually takes care of it.

 Although the gas is non-spec, the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough 
 that it can be blended okay before reaching Beaumont.  GO FOR IT.
 
 As a precaution, we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious.  
 Once we connect a well, we can't go backwards.  Please be specific with GMT 
 and limit him to this one well.  Otherwise he could drill more wells and flow 
 them ALL through this new meter.
