 today's stranded costs. I know what California utility commissioners
 must be going through as they seek solutions for problems with roots going
 back at least a decade. They'd better have thick skins and nimble minds.
 I'll never forget former Gov. Jim Thompson, whose 1982 campaign I co-managed
 and who appointed me to the ICC, saying, after several big rate increases,
 the political equivalent of "I've never seen this man before in my entire
 life." Having been yelled at on the bus by angry consumers a few times on
 the way to the office, I could only be happy that Thompson had the good
 political judgment to say, "I know not the man," on his own without my
 prompting. I felt proud, not betrayed.
