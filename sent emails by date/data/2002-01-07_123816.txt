 Marty: Further to Bob Crotty's voicemail message to you of earlier today, I
 attach a draft of the stipulation that we have been discussing relating to
 production of documents and segregation in connection with the Sequoia,
 Cherokee, EFP adversary proceeding.  Please contact either me or Bob Crotty
 (212-808-7847) if you have questions or comments.  We would like to file
