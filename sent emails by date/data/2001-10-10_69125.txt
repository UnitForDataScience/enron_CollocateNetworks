Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.  She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi. Gate.  I would think that there would not be that much difference between NG and Chi Gate.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

 Hi Nilay,
 The curves below have not been mapped.  It's causing a problem with a traders VaR.
 
 
 EMERSON-US/IM: Map to NG and to OMICRON_5
 
 GDC-CHI./N/BORD: Map to NGI/CHI.GATE and OMICRON_11
 
 GDP-EMERSON: Map to NG and OMICRON_5
 
 IF-MONCHY: Map to NG and OMICRON_5
 
 IF-NGPL/OK-NW: Map to and OMICRON_11
 
 NGPL-IOWA-ILLIN:  Map to NG and OMICROM_11
