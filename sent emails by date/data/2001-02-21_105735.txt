 Fred has asked that we prepare an ISDA between ENA and Northern Border 
 Partners, L.P., which is also a wholly owned Enron subsidiary.  Should we 
 prepare an RMA or regular ISDA?  I have provided a worksheet that contains 
 Enron's ownership structure and little else.  Let me know if I should provide 
 another worksheet with more detail.
 
 thanks
