 a negotiated solution with legislators and the Governor, but I can't verify 
 and don't have details on what the negotiated agreement might look like.  
 While's Sandi's away, have asked Mona to check in with our Sacramento 
 lobbyists to poke around for information.  Will report back soon as we get 
 more info.

 What is going on with this issue politically?  If PG&E gets its rate cap 
 removed, we need to make sure that this doesn't create more problems for 
 wholesale markets?

 California's largest utility is pushing to end a four-year-old retail rate
 freeze that has protected millions of Northern Californians from the price
 volatility in the wholesale electricity market that  rocked San Diego this
 summer.  PG&E Corp. wants to end the price freeze imposed in 1996 by the
 state legislature because it is losing money under the arrangement.  PG&E's
 move is going to set the stage for a major confrontation between the utility
 and state regulators  she said further, " [T]he
 legislature feels like somebody who's fallen into poison oak enough times
 that all we have to do is walk past a bush and we break out in a rash.
 That's the way we react to these energy issues."
