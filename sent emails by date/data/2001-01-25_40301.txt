 she doesn't hear from them by tomorrow morning, can Cara and I have a 
 conference call with you at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so you can birddog people 
 and get some answers?  In the meantime, if Cara E-mailed you the questions, 
 would you answer any you know the answers to. Thanks.

 the reports.
 Thank you
