 Indicated Shippers in their Reply to our Reply brief (at 19) argue that we =
 implied that our capacity postings are consistent with the standardized Gis=
 b format.  They compare our postings to NGPL's, which are different, to sup=
 port their argument.  Then they conclude that there is no standardized GISB=
  capacity-posting format.  Is this true?  How can we respond if this comes =
 up at oral argument tomorrow?  Maria
