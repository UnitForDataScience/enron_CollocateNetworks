On the otherhand, there is no reason that a DASH can't be used for non-discretionary approvals as well, and if it doesn't have to go to RAC, then it doesn't.

 kent, et al, 
 quick feedback from rod:
 1. gas purchase - need to get approved thru stan    $'s required make it a Stan approval.    We will need a DASH to get his signature on.
 2. hedge of gas purchase - no issues; need to quickly develop hedge documentation     
 3. hedge of sba "spread" - we need to regroup to better clarify how the commodity component of the sba can be identified within the
 sba contract, for hedge purposes
