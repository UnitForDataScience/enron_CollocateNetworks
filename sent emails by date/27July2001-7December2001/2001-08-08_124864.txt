 Murray,
 We tally up our exposure each day based on the California flash.  Our monthly exposure can be found at P:\RealTime\Exposure\August Exposure.
 We are keeping a very close eye on it.
 
 Thanks,

 Jim,
 We have congestion revenue again for 08_07.
 We moved 272 mws at $194.
 Total revenue should be $52768.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
