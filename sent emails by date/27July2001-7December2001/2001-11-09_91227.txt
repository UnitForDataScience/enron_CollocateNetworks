Apparently, the people on our trading desk dealt with the customer without getting legal input. Scary. You may want to check with Jim Keller's/Mike Smith's group to see if anyone there knows anything about this.

 Richard,
 I have attached the financial deals in RGS for 2001 where the originator is VEG Desk. Russ and I had discussed these deals with you a few weeks ago. Can you please verify that the pricings are correct, as we have nothing to verify these against. Thank you
 
 Jennifer
