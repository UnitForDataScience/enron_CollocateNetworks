 	"You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation,
 	why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR?  Wouldn't that help the system?"  I think it would be
 	hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all
 	at the same time.  What do you guys think?  Thanks. Lynn
