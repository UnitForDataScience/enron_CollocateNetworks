 another question.  My family (four people) is going to Boston on September 2, 
 returning to SF on September 9.  I noticed on United's website that they have 
 round trip for about $365 and I was wondering if you folks can better that?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I am going to email the itinerary to you now. It will have all the
 information on it.
