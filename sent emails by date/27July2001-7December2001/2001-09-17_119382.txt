 You might try these:
 
 In Sedona:
   Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)
 
 In Scottsdale/Phoenix:
   Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews)
   The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool)
   The Boulders (also highly rated)
 
 At the Canyon
   El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)
 
 In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon):
   The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon
 
   I am trying to reschedule Amanda's return ticket.  I understand
    from
    American that I have to do it through Cunard.  Do you have a contact
    over
    there?  If not I'll just do the 800 number thing.
 
    I want her to come home.  We will take a stateside vacation over the
    next
    week and not linger over there.  What is your opinion?  Did you feel
    unsafe
    there?  There is a lot of sword rattling going on right now.
