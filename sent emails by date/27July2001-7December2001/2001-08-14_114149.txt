 I am hoping that you can help me with a confirm issue.  When CP&L is the
 Seller and EPMI is the Buyer, the CP&L confirm people have been marking
 through our Product description which says "Into Cinergy, Seller's daily
 Choice" and putting "Firm LD" instead.  Now that we are confirming under
 the EEI Master which defines both of these products, we would request
 that your people not mark through the description.  Do you agree and an
 you facilitate this?
