 We are really looking forward to having you on the team.  The new trading floor is awesome.  Feel free to take a couple extra days if you need them.

 Phillip Allen passed your resume to me.  I would like to discuss the possibilty of you spending your first rotation in Houston with Mike Grigsby and myself on the west natural gas trading desk.  I understand that you are a trading candidate and a rotation on the west desk would fulfill one of the program requirements.  I will be in London November 9th, please let me know if you can spare a few minutes.
 
 Thanks
