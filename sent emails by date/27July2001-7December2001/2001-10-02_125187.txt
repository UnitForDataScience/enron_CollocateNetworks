 published around this time. This curve is probably in the system as basis, code D, which is the
 difference between the Index and NYMEX settle. This index is the Oct price curve (P) plus the Oct 
 basis curve (D). Deals are +/- a few cents for 
 The index (I) curve is next month's curve at what these differentials are trading at. It is not the actual
 "index". It is what is added to the index for physical deals priced off index.
 I know it is confusing.

 Jason,
 
 	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
 	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
 	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
 	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
 	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
 	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.
