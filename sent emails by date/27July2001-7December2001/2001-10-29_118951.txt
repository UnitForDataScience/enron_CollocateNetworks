Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex.

 We just have been asked to review on an expedited basis all material contracts of ENE and ENA for change-of-control type provisions.  Please let us know what contracts or guidance you may have or know of; we need to begin reviewing/collecting information ASAP, i.e., this weekend.  If you know of someone who should receive this e-mail but who has not, please forward.  You may contact me at any of the below numbers.  
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Regards, NJD
