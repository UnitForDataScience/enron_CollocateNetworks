 I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents Stephanie forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get Fred involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from Enron Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or Ken Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.

 Tanya/Jay,
 I am forwarding to you documentation from Westport Resources Corporation regarding the merger with Belco Oil & Gas.  As you know, we have existing financial agreements with both companies, as identified below:
 
 Belco Oil & Gas - Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated July 8, 1999, which has unlimited credit
 Westport Oil & Gas Company, Inc. - ISDA Master Agreement dated March 17, 1998
 
 The Counterparty wants to retain the Belco Master.  Please let me know what Credit wants to do.
 
 Stephanie
