For legal and credit reasons this  is not doable.  I await their response on this issue.  Lora Aria has asked me to proceed with my review process setting aside the issue of party names and I am doing so.

  Please send a credit worksheet for Kentucky Utilities Company.   My contact says LG&E / KUC purchase and sell as the same entity?
