 Got the pictures. Thank you very much. Do you stock those wheels and tires or would I have to order them?

    Al,
 
    I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
    winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
    recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
    something that would work. Thanx for your time.
