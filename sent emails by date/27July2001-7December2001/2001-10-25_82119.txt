 Did Brad answer your question?  I've been in NYMEX hell all day and I am not up on this issue.  Let me know if I can help further.

 Winston,
 Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?
 Thanks
