 Let's talk asap regarding this transportation. I can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place. You had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south. We have some 1,2 year service starting now, and we have the five year to PG&E.( we also have the baja).  
 
 25th of month following on payables is normal protocol...that works fine!
 
 I had assumed that for starting out, we would only work on sales to you on a Cash basis, or very short term( intra-month).
 
 
 Thanks in advance,  Barry Tycholiz
