 ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
 s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
 e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
 mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
  that Enron was going to be the "World's Leading Company."  He even put the=
  goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
 ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
 ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
 opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
 high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
  +/- 20%. =20
 
 Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
 s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
 aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
 ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
 vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
  entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
 forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
 e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
 han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
 her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
 heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
  the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.
 
 It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
 industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
 s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
  and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=
 o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=
 horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=
 ur millions.....
