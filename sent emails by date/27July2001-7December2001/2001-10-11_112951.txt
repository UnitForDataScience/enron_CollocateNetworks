  you guys are probably aware of this, but just in case you aren't, there was an article in the Minneapolis paper yesterday that Xcel (NSP) had filed on Friday with FERC to transfer it's transmission system to a new company called TransLink Transmission Co.  Joining them are Alliant, Corn Belt Coop (Iowa), Mid AMerican, NPPD, and OPPD.  
 
 I noted that there was a quote in the article that "Xcel estimates that it would cut its overal transmission related fees by more than a thrid through it's participation in Translink.......because there will be less overlap of functions."
