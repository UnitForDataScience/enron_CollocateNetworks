The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.
 
 ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].
 
 Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.

 Sara,
 
 I just left you a voice mail about this.
 
 We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.
 
 Please tell me if this can happen.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tom
