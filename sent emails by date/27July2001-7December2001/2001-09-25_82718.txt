       Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I
    really
       don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He
    has
       threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
       scared.
       I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so
    bad,
       and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing
    to
       do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
       chooses
       not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial
    difficulties.
       This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I
    don't
       know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him
    has
       done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more
    he
       could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids
    and
       what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that
    I
       do
       to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.
