 Kirk -
 
 Thank you for your timely feedback. Per our discussions, we have updated
 all of the topic frameworks and attached them below. In addition, Monica
 has sent you an email describing the changes she has made and explanations
 around why some changes weren't made (SME's responses to your questions).
 
 These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total of one hour.
