 I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me and my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?
 
 Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?  Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to Tonya?  I don't understand....
 
 I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.  I hope that helps
 
 Thanks again,
 
 -Joe

    Dear Joe,
 
    Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about 3:00
    p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could
    come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my son's
    soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for you???
