 You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......
 
 How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.  She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.  
 
 You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk.

    Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
    extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
    card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
    sickness.
    I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
    still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
    4th
    grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
    prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's
    dumb
    and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter
    last
    night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
    not.
    She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me
    so
    bad.
 
    Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
    best
    thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.
 
    How's the school search going for Jordan?
