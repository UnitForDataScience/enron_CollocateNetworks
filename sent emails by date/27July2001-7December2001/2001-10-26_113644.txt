 Tell your mom I'll call her this weekend.  I plan on being at your mom's house the whole day (I don't want to impose..but I'm sure she won't mind)  I don't have to go to the dentist on Friday so I'm free the whole day lets do something.  I'll call you on sat.

                Bird, where you in town this weekend? I talked to your sister for a 
    little while and she said you might be coming into town. 
    The Astros are good.  What's going on with Peyton? I am sure Tonya is 
    being reasonable again.
