
 
 As usual, your position is way too logical.   Do I need to attend this meeting?
 
  
   
  
 This will confirm a meeting on the referenced subject tomorrow, Sept. 5th, at 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. in EB-872.    (Please note the time change from an earlier email.)
 
 Please let me know if you have a conflict.
 
 Thanks,
 Cheryl
