 	in the office Wednesday.  You can coordinate with him and Terry Kowalke to get everyone
 	set up.  Thanks. Lynn

 Martha,
 As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.
 They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?
 Thanks,
 Courtney Barker
