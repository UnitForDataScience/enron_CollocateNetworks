 I am moving to the 3AC2092 with Bruce Lundstrom's group but will keep my same phone extension. They will be moving to the "old" Azurix floors in another three weeks, and I plan to move with them. I hope this meets with your approval. They are literally taking the furniture apart on the 19th floor and dismantling the entire office.
