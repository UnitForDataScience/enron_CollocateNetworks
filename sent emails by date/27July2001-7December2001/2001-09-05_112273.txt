 Jim,
 
 I listened into the call for the PUC press conference and they plan to go forward with the vote tomorrow regarding direct access; however, they will not vote on the rate order until a later time due to the high volume of comments (they predict it will be voted on before Sept. 20th though.)  Let me know if you need more info about the call.  Thanks, A.
