 Linda, 
 
 Regarding the grid safety issue, you will remember that I mentioned
 yesterday that Saxby Chambliss has been tapped by the Speaker to coordinate
 the terrorism package. I spoke with Krister Holladay of Chambliss' office
 today, who is staffing that effort and he said he would be more than happy
 to look at any and all proposals and suggestions that we have on grid
 safety. He hasn't seen anything yet on this issue and would welcome our
 input. 
 
 If the folks in Houston can identify two or three (or more) things that can
 be done to enhance safety that also move grid management in the direction we
 want it to go generally, this will be a fine opportunity to broaden our
 coalition on transimission / rto's. 
 
 It looks like we have an open door here. Let me know what you want me to do.
