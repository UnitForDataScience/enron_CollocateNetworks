 Best,
 Jeff
 
  and we believe the
 course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any
 energy-related organization that they would join.  You can see a copy of
 last year's course syllabus at
  http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste/EnergyMarketsSyllabus.pdf
 
 Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
 employment starting as early as May.  If you have openings that you would
 like to advertise to these students, please let me know.  We will be
 setting up a webpage with job announcements in energy-related
 organizations.  If you send me a job description (or the URL for it), I
 can add it to the webpage.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Severin
