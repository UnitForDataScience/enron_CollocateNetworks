 Per our conversation, I am trying to put together some data on the status of gas markets in California, Nevada, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Oregon.  In particular I need the gas market characteristics in these states.  Are the markets open to retail competition for commercial and industrial customers and if so, what are the requirements and are there some limitations.  Please E-mail me your response as I will be in Long Beach tomorrow.
 
 Thanks.
