 how's this for the daily update:    "Today was a very difficult day for
 us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The
 Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible
 mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is
 considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these
 reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market
 speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all
 options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep
 you updated on developments as they occur"
