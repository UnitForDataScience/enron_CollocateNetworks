 How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.
  

 

 
 
             
    Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I really
    don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He has
    threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
    scared.
    I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so bad,
    and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing to
    do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
    chooses
    not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial difficulties.
    This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I don't
    know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him has
    done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more he
    could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids and
    what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that I
    do
    to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.
