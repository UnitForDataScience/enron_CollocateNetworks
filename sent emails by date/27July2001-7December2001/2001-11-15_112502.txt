 Jim,
 
 We have to file a report  under project 22834 - pilot reporting in Texas today.  The data will be available at 4PM. Who on your team can I coordinate with to submit the actual filing?
 
 The procedure to submit the filing can be located on the Texas PUC website   http://www.puc.state.tx.us/   left-hand side, filings.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 Rebecca
