 Prediction Company was confused. No problem - I got the outline from memory and I shall cc 
 you. I shall attach your minutes to my memo for Greg.

 Steve,
 
 Two things. 
 
 1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
 I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but
 want to make sure I did not miss any important point.
 
 2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship,
 how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly,
 Houston? Please, let me know.
 
 Vince
