 Remember they make  great gifts especially at Thanksgiving.  You can have them cracked at the  Farmers Market for about .25/pound.  Tell your friends but hurry  supplies are limited. I will keep a supply until December 1 and then I will  take what I have left to the wholesaler.
  
 Help the poor  downtrodden farmer.  We have taken it on the chin the last couple of  years with the severe drought and heat that we have  experienced.
  
 E-mail your orders  are call me at 254.
  
  
 Sincerely,
  
 Farmer  Brown(alias)
