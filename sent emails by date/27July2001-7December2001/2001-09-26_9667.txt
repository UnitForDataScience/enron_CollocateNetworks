 ch.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this=
  week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around peop=
 le availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The sc=
 hedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate tw=
 o hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had n=
 ot been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on =
 that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have=
  a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting th=
 at Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs throu=
 gh the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a =
 religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on =
 Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets toget=
 her.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orche=
 strated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW me=
 eting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the com=
 mitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution =
 that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise.=

 Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES=
  budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine t=
 he appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all=
  of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have do=
 ne this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That =
 is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provide=
 d and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggest=
 ed split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the dec=
 ision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of th=
 e chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets t=
 ogether, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer=
  block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting a=
 t 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule t=
 hat works for both of us. =20
 
 We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that =
 until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the=
  components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of cos=
 ts and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussio=
 n.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had b=
 een reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for d=
 iscussion on that.    =
