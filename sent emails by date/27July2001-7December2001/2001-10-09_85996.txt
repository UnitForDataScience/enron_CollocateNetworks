 Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!
 
 Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.  Let me know when you get some time.

 Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell
 you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.
 
 I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
 Take care.  Paul.
