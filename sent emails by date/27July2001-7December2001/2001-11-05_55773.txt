 		Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,
 
 		Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
 		It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
 		Thank you for your time.
 
 		I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
 		However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
 		attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
 		get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
 		in school.
 
 		I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
 		Thank you.
