 It appears my TDS is linked to Keith's book and not mine.  I don't mind having access to his position, and i actually will probably want it, but the book names probably got confused since his is WT and mine is WC.

 Kam,
 
 Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.
