          Dear Joe,
 
          Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at
    about
       3:00
          p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you
    could
          come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my
       son's
          soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for
       you???
