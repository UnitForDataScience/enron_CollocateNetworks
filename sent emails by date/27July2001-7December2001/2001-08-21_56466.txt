 Joe
 Thank you very much for sparing your time with me, yesterday, and explaining
 Enron's dynamic and aggressive business.  It was very impressive and
 intriguing.
 
 I have revised my resume and have added information regarding the actual
 systems and projects which I have worked on both for Salomon Brothers and
 Toshiba.  I have attached a list of publication also.
 
 Please feel free to let me know if you need further information.
 
 I will await for a feedback from you, regarding where I might fit in within
 the Enron organization.
 
 Best Regards
 Niki
