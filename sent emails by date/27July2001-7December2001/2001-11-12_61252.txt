 Hi all,
 
 We need to figure out how much we owe and to who now.  I think we all
 agreed
 we would not include food now, only the flowers, stuffed animals, cake and
 stroller.
 
 Tori, you mentioned to me you spent $65.00 on the cake, flowers and
 animals.
 
 Dana, can you please let us know the total for the stroller?  If you did
 already I apologize.  I don't remember it.
 
 I think Saturday went great...we all worked so well together and Jennifer
 was very happy.  Cheers to us!
 
 Thanks!
