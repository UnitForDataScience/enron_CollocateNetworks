  to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
 	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.
 
 If anyone has any questions, just let us know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
