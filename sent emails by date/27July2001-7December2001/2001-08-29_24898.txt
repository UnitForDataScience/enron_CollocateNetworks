 John,
 
 Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be:
 
 Movers - $7500 CND
 Flight - $1500 CND
 Temp. Accomodations - $1500 CND
 October Rent - $1500 CND
 
 I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet.

 John,
 
 Did you have a chance to talk to Dawn / Milly? Even if you want to work the flight / hotel / movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a "signing bonus" or something that would probably work. I am going to take a bath on my car in a big way. The option of moving my it back to Canada is out of the question as I just found out I would have to pay 6.1% import duty, 7% GST and about $400 in excise taxes and permits. Let me know.
