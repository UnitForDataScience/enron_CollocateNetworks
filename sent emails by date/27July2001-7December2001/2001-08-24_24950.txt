 I bought a brownstone in the River Park / Altadore area. #402 3511 14a St. SW. A really cool area and a great place. We will have to grab some sushi and catch up when I get back.
 
 Talk to you soon.

    Hi Chris,
 
    I hope you are well keeping cool in Houston!  I just wanted to let you
    know
    that Leigh and I got engaged atop Mt Temple last weekend.  I wanted you
    to
    hear it from me.  I would love  to hear from you when you get a chance!!
    I
    am spending all my time right now deciding on a honeymoon destination!!
 
    I hope all is well.
 
    Kerrie
