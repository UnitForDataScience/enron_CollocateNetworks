 much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a=
  change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think t=
 hat there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that par=
 t.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice. =
  Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suza=
 nne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with C=
 orporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay o=
 n with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this w=
 ay, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES=
  gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Than=
 ksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip=
  - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse =
 to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out wi=
 th myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?=
   I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the ho=
 liday season and time for (good) cheer!

 You have two cows.
 You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
 credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a
 debt/equity
 swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back,
 with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
 transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned
 by
 the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to
 your
 listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
 an
 option on one more.
