 I looked Ed O up in the directory and he was listed as an EES VP in origination. He told me Mark Taylor told him to call me to get information.  Sound OK? Thanks

 Elizabeth,
 
 I have attached the index language we are currently using in confirmation letters.
 
  << File: Index Language Power.doc >> 
 
 The Megawatt Daily Index language in the above attachment is used for Cinergy and Comed (the delivery points are not listed in the example).
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
