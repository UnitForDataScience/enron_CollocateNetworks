 I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.   Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).
  
 Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.   This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.
  
 Call me with any additional questions.
 
  e.g., sell them a put option on the CT-LI bi-directional spread to insure some minimum cash flow on the line, in return for them selling us a call on the spread.
 
 I am beginning to work with structuring to pull some values together, but I wanted to get your input on how to proceed.  Can we plan to speak sometime today/tomorrow?  Please let me know what times work for the two of you.  Thanks
