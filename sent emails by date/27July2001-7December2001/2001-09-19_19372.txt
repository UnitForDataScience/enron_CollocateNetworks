 Best,

 Hey Great to hear from you.
 
 I CAN BE REACHED AT 415-713-4473 (this is my cell
 phone and you can reach me on it anytime.)
 
 I was just going to call you.  I just left the Yankee
 Group and am looking for my next opportunity.  That
 gig was just not working out for me and I decided to
 move on. Tina and I are now living in Albuquerque NM
 and searching for some new opportunities.  I'd love to
 get back to California, but am looking elsewhere as
 well.   
 
 Hope all is well.  Take care.
 
 Give me a ring sometime.
