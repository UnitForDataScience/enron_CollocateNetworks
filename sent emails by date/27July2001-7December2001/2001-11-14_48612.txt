 Instructions:
 
 From your Lotus Notes Workspace choose File - Database - Open.  This will bring up the Open Database Dialog (shown below).  In the Server drop down list, choose "ECTHOU_LN1/ECT".  Once this is selected, find and double-click on the "Legal" folder.  Next, in the Database list, find the "Financial Trading Agreements" database and double-click (or click Open).  The database will then be added to your Lotus Notes Workspace.
