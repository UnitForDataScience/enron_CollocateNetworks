 > Of the US Henry Bath operations, only 4 employees have been offered
 > employment through Enron.  Currently the following 4 are employed
 > through Enron Metals & Commodity Corp and by default receive all Enron
 > benefits under our US plans.

 > 	Martha Horne
 > 	Isoji (David) Sato
 > 	Mary Buck
 > 	Daisy Leung
 >
 > The main reason they were hired through Enron Metals was due to the
 > fact that a US Henry Bath company had not been set up that could
 > provide benefits and payroll.  Prior to Enron's arrival all Henry Bath
 > employees were employed by a third party professional employer
 > organization called Worldtec Group International. All other HB
 > employees continue to be employed and receive benefits from Worldtec.
 >
 > I've attached some additional information about Worldtec as well as a
 > copy of the POE Service Agreement executed by Martha Horne (for HB)
 > and T.G. Plate (for Worldtec).

 > As we discussed, given these circumstance, any potential buyer of HB

 > In addition, the buyer should be prepared provide the 4 employees
 > mentioned above with some level of equivalent benefits, but not
 > necessarily adopt Enron's benefits plans.  In the event that you still
 > need to review Enron's plan documents for benefits, pension, etc.,
