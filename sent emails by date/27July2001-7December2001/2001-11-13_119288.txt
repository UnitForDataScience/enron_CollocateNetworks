Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.
 
 It has been chaotic and very depressing here 

    
 Mark,
 You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
 Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
 write.
 
 Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
 it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
 No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
 of you.
 
 We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
 am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
 for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
 out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
 late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
 were still living in a hotel then....
 
 I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
 to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
 the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
 rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
 rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??
 
 All best,
 Hal
