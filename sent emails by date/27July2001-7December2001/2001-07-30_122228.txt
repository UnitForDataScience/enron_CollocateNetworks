 Let's book lunch on the 10th.  Let's talk early that morning to confirm time and flavor of food.  I'm looking forward to it!
  
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  please order 14 15" flat screens (and cards), and 1 Compaq M300 with all accessories (docking station, DVD, memory, bag, additonal larger battery).  
  
 
 Please code everything towards the "Marketing 41k refresh" bucket.  I estimate totol purchase amount to be $14,000.
