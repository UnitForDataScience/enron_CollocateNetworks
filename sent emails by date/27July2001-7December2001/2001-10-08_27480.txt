 Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?
 
 Thanks,

 On 9/17 there is a start charge for 1376.90.  I spoke with Lisa and she said we incur these charges when we do not call on an option, or when we miss calling on an option for 12 consecutive hours.  In this particular case, she said we incurred the charge because we called again on it.  Do you know where in the contract that it talks about this?
 
 Thanks,
