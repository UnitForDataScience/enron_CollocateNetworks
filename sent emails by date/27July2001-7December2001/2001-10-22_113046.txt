
 
 A few notes.
 
 1.	Be cautious about divestiture.  Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.
 
 2.	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.
 
 3.	POLR issue involves getting pricing right.
 
 Why don't you put together a note to the CAEM that we can send as our thoughts.  Just the Top 5 issues.
