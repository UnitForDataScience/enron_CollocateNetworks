 "For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission 
 involved) use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the 
 first line and the words "Single Bus" in the OASIS reservation field and 
 "7-F" as the Product." 
 
 Is this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID 
 Columbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C 
 are have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a "TP 
 specific transmission path or designation".  It was agreed to use "Single 
 Bus" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service 
 where no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. 
 
 If the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that 
 point then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for 
 their transmission portion, but may be "GF" or "No reservation required" 
 from the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not 
 MIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in?
