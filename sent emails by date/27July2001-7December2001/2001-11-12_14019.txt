 Thanks for the information, however I have a question for the 14
 individuals in which we have "No record in SAP".   Do we know for certain
 that these individuals where not employed with Enron , or is it that there
 is no record of them in SAP HR.  Would a query out of the HR datawarehouse
 tell us more information?
 
 Thanks,
 Kevin
