 Nelson,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals?
 
  
     
 Gerald,
 
 When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.
 
 Confirmation Usage		
 		
 Form	Deal Type	
 GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
 GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
 Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
 GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
 GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	
 
 Thanks,
 Judy
