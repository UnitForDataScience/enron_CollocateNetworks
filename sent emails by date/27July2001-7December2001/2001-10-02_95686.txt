 How's everything going -I assume great?  How's the baby and Patty
 doing?
 
 How 'bout that Barry Bonds?  You must be in heaven - (1) baby boy,
 (2) Yanks win the division, (3) Bonds goes for record.
 
 I think Bonds is going to break the record Wednesday night in Houston.
 Guess who'll be sitting in section 154 (check it out on the Astros
 website) waiting for # 71.  Look for me on TV.

 Sorry so late.
