 Inc. (North America), will be in Houston Dec 3 and Dec 4 to introduce
 himself

 retired in September.
 
 Mike would now be available to meet with yourself and Louise Kitchen and
 others as you recommend:

 Monday, Dec 3 -  2:00 p.m. or later  (Dinner is still open as well)
 Tuesday, Dec 4 -  8:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m.
 
 Please let me know as soon as you can - as you can appreciate I have to
 fill in the above windows very soon.
 
 Thanks,
