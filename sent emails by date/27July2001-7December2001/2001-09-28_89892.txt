 Stuart/Jon - I have updated the Loss calc for New Albany with actuals thru August.  Forecasted Loss is $1.1MM.  Please let me know if you have any changes to the reserve.  Any OEC costs associated with closing the facility will be accrued in September to the LLC and are not included as part of this calc.  Please call me with any questions.
 
 Trey/Susan - I just found out yesterday that they are trying to close this next week - 3rd quarter deal.
