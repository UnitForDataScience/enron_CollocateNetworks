 Today after the Hearing I attended lunch with John Anderson and Phil Harris=
 .  One of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond t=
 o the NERC legislative efforts?
 
 Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over rel=
 iability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.  Agreeing to that, the i=
 dea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to=
  that language.  =20
 
 I think that internally Enron is already there???  John Shelk, if you could=
  pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that=
  would be very helpful.
 
 I'll let you know how we next proceed.  If anyone has any problems, please =
 let me know. =20
 
 Thanks.
