  abdicate its responsibilities to the people of California.    
 
  
 
 This is a decision based on the unconstitutional scheme laid out in AB1X, and it's unconscionable for the PUC to vote away its own most precious function: providing accountability for just and reasonable rates for the people of California.
 
  
 
 For these reasons, I cannot urge in stronger terms that the PUC take the following actions tomorrow on the draft decision:
 
  
 
 1.      Suspend action on the draft decision until the extraordinary constitutional questions are resolved 
 
 2.      Seek immediate resolution of these constitutional questions by initiating a lawsuit against the Legislature and the Governor 
 
 3.      Adopt regulatory and statutory changes to ensure that public oversight and accountability for just and reasonable rates continues
 
  
 
             California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all of our sakes, and the future of our state, this must not be allowed to happen.
