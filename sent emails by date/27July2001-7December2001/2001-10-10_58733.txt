 I have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think?
 
 
  
 
  
     
 Key question: is the "electricity gerrymandering" too tough?
 
 While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.
 
 We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.
