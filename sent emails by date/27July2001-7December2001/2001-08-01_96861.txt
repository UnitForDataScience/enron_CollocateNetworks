      In response to the ERCOT market transition, and the fact that "UB" is
 no longer an accurate ERCOT product description, on a going forward basis,
 unless otherwise specifically instructed by the Trade Floor or the
 Origination Group, please identify ERCOT products as "Firm-LD" [as defined
 under Schedule P of the EEI Agreement] (obviously, if we have an EEI in
 place with a counterparty the bracketed part is not necessary, but if not,
 it needs to be included).  Under the "Delivery Point" heading please state:
 "Seller's choice of any available interface(s) within the ERCOT control
 area."  I will let you know if/when any of this changes.  In the meantime,
 refer any customer response to this confirmation change to the Trade Floor
 and/or Legal.
 
      Thank you.

 P.S.  To John Ritch: Please let me know if this is OK or if you want to
 change it in any way.  If OK, please forward this to your traders.
