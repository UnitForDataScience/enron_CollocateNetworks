 	these emails are going, then we do NOT need to meet.  Let me
 	know if you feel like we need to group together to finalize this issue
 	and be sure we are on the same page.  Otherwise, I would ask that
 	Maggie or Hasan do a final results email and let us know what the
 	outcome is.  Thanks for everyone's help on getting this issue behind us.

 All,
 some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity reports in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  Since the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones, the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of reports that are used for same information.
 
 At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old reports as part of changes implemented on 10/13.
 
 Thanks
