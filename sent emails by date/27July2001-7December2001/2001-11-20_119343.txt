 John, said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan.  I added a table of contents, and if John gives me anything to add I will.
 
 I am going home (LA) tomorrow so I might work half a day.    
 
 



   
 I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any.
