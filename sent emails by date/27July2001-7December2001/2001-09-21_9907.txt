 	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
 	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
 	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
 	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  
 
 	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
 	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
 	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

 	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
 	helps simplify our answer to your question.  
 
 	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
 	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
 	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)
 
 	For Nominating purposes:
 
 	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
 	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.
 
 	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.
 
 	EXAMPLE:
 
 	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
 	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
 	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
 	overrun at IT rate.
 
 	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
