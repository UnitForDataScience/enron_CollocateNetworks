 	Have you heard back from Jerry?  Do you need me to try calling Delaine again?  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 It has come to light, by way of a Wego driver, that Enron has been billed for the liquids that were produced from Oneok facilities.  After further discussion it was discovered that the Hugoton plant as well as some field locations in the Liberal Region are also being billed to Enron instead of Oneok.  This problem may need to be investigated further and a plan to correct this implemented.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
 
 Respectfully,
