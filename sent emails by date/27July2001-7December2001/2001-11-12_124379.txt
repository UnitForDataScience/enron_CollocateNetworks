Didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you!  I hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty.  
  
 The kids are great!  Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and Lauren get along really well.
  
 Too hard to tell what will happen with Dynegy.  Not sure I want to work for this new regime.  I guess it all comes down to money.  As always I'm still a whore.
