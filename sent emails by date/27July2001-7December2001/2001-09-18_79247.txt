      I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.  Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.  I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.  If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop. 
      When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia?
      Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.

 Pam:
 
 Danny requested that we set up one day next week for the ETS employees to view the new furniture. A memo would be sent out to all ETS employees inviting them to come by and view the new furniture. 
 
 Please advise the exact location of the room that showcases the furniture and Danny suggested that the assistants being on hand in the room (which I understand is now located on the 4th floor).  Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you, Joan and the assistants each covering one hour.  A hour coverage will not impact anyone's schedule and allow everyone an opportunity to view the furniture.  
 
 I propose Tuesday, September 19th and the following schedule.  The assistants will be notified of the schedule once we confirm the date.
 
 8:00 - 9:00	Joan Lipuscek
 9:00 - 10:00	Audrey Robertson
 10:00 - 11:00	Susan Wadle
 11:00 - 12:00	Linda Wehring
