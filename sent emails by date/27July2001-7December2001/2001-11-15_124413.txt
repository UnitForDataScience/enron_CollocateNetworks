 heard last night that forest oil is marketing through aec again in
 december.  also heard they have been instructed not to sell to enron.  aec
 has also received directives not to sell to enron.  are you hearing that a
 lot?
 
 sorry to open with negative news.  hope you're doing well today.  i'm a bit
 tired.  was up late for the avs game last night then got up early for my
 training at the gym this morning.  may require high amounts of caffeine
 today.
 
 might do a quick drink with a friend tonight.  are you working out after
 work?  if you have no plans maybe you could meet us for a drink.  it will
 be an early night for me.
 
 have a great day
