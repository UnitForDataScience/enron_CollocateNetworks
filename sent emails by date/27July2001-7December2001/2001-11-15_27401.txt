 e,  but I told him that a monkey-man wouldnt interpret the protocols that w=
 ay.
 Its the Dynegy thang talking.

 David,
 I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:
 
 Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, s=
 tarting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi=
 ds exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
 The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium =
 is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formu=
 la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is =
 zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An=
  announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=
 ut this week,  per Mark Patterson.
 
 The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=
 l energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =
 a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=
 rotocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services=
  with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=
 pirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.
 
   =20
 Here is the problem:
 the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols=
  to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=
 atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were=
  not generating into the grid.
 We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=
 ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =
 for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=
 cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=
 un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=
 c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.
 
 I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=
 is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=
 cot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at=
  their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=
 c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =
 for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=
 d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark=
  also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=
 ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me "dont worry,=
   you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=
 st money."
 
 
 
 Here is my view:
 OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =
 Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
 Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =
 a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
 If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=
 ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =
 imbalance.
 OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=
 ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
 Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=
 pes of filing for a "breakeven."   Ridiculous.
 
 I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment=
 " on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has "no comme=
 nt."
 Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=
 sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same=
  path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =
 receive.
 
 I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=
 e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=
 rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =
 to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=
 w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =
 Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=
 ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
 Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=
 ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=
 e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20
 We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=
 led.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full=
  load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =
 the unit.    Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=
 quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME."
 The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=
 struction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=
 uction on a regular basis?
 
 Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via=
  OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=
 vironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=
 onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to=
  OOME our plant."
 
 Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, =
  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.
 
 Thanks,
