 Ron, 
 	can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.
 
 thanks
