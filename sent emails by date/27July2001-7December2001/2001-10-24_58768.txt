 n the kinds of circumstances you describe.  Unfortunately, I'm going throug=
 h some of the same things (on a smaller scale).  We are having to let peopl=
 e go in my organization.  I simply don't have room, even for a qualified pe=
 rson like Maurice.
 Does Global markets still have a presence in Singapore?  If so, perhaps the=
 re is an opportunity there.
 
  
     
 Anthony and Chor-Lim,
 
 Thank you for agreeing to help me market myself within Enron.  Since I am s=
 o new to the company, your help will be invaluable.
 
 Here is my updated CV and a companion paper providing more detail.  Please =
 distribute them as you deem appropriate.
