Have people from different industry groups discussing their views of where the mediations concluded (assuming we are finished by October).  Any outstanding issues between EPSA members and between EPSA and other parts of the industry could be discussed.
 
 Thanks,

 Do either of you have any suggestions for topics to focus on at the
 Regulatory Affairs Committee Meeting in October?  At the last meeting we
 talked about market-based rate issues; the one before that, gas issues.  We
 had thought of a "dialogue" with some senior FERC staff and a few of our
 members about big picture issues, but haven't been able to organize it.  We
 could try that again.  Or, what about interconnection issues or information
 collection/disclosure, since those seem to be rocketing up FERC's priority
 list.  Any suggestions?
