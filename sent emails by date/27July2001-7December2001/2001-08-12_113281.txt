 I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination =
 and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we est=
 ablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =
 and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=
 ron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=
 reen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=
 r fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=
 lion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =
 nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=
 shing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=
  market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=
 rnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=
 demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=
 lls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=
 easing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=
  it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =
 market-maker in the renewable power sector.
 
 I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =
 and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=
 nated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=
 is.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=
 signate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=
  follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=
 da, and hope you will be able to attend.
