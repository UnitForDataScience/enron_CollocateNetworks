 This is the stipulation we were able to receive from PG&E to allow Lisa and I to negotiate a stipulation within the next 48 hours.  We will keep you posted.

 This will confirm the agreement of PG&E not to take any action for 48 hours
 with respect to our ongoing disputes with Enron.  We will meet with you and
 your client tomorrow in an effort to formulate a process for resolution of
 outstanding issues.
 
 Obviously, this is without prejudice to anyone's rights.
