Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.
 
 In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas  I am trying to reschedule Amanda's return ticket.  I understand from
 American that I have to do it through Cunard.  Do you have a contact over
 there?  If not I'll just do the 800 number thing.
 
 I want her to come home.  We will take a stateside vacation over the next
 week and not linger over there.  What is your opinion?  Did you feel unsafe
 there?  There is a lot of sword rattling going on right now.
