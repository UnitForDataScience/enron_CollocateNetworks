 Kim -
 Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.
