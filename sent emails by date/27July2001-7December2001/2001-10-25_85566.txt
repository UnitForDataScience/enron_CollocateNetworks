 Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:
 
 	1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.  
 	2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.
 	
 I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
