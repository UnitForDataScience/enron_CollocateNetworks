I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.  
 
 I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility 
     
 Reminder, the meeting to discuss the Alliant measurement issue is at 3:30 Monday in 49c2. sj
