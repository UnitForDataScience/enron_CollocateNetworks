 on language.  On this issue, I would argue that any penalty imposed should =
 remain the purview of FERC and its procedures.

 Attached are: (1) highlights summary; (2) section-by-section summary; and (=
 3) almost 150 pages of leg text (PDF doc) on Chairman Barton's draft electr=
 icity restructuring bill.  The RTO and bundled/unbundled sections will be p=
 rovided "soon" (they day) (I am meeting with Mr. Barton's staff in a half h=
 our), but there are "voluntary RTO" provisions in the incentive pricing sec=
 tion since they lifted that language from Burr-Sawyer legislation.  Mr. Bar=
 ton has publicly said his addedum will mandate RTO participation at some po=
 int; I should know more after the meeting.  The draft below addresses a var=
 iety of issues, including TVA, BPA, etc., among others, that we also care a=
 bout.  There is a retail consumer aggregation feature toward the end.  If y=
 ou could look at the summary and section-by-section and let me know particu=
 lar areas of interest/concern for further review that would be helpful.  Ba=
 rton is taking comments through this week and next week.
