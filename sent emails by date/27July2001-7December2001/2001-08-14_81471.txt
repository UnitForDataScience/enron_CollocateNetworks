   This does not constitute an official document. If you have not received
   your itinerary/receipt by fax or mail prior to the date of travel, please
   pick-up the itinerary/receipt at any Air Canada ticket counter if you are
   travelling between Canada and another country. If you are travelling within
   Canada, you only need to obtain a boarding pass at the airport check-in
   counter, or at the departure gate if travelling without checked luggage.
