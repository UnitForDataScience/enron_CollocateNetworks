                   I have a pair of shoe trees that are slightly too big for
    my
             shoes.
                Do
                   you
                   want a look.  I'd give them to you, but I need a pair
       myself,
          and
             I'm
                   cheap.
                   I suggest some sort of sale whereby we both win.  I sell
    you
          the
             new
                   shoe
                   trees for a discount (you win) and I use that money to
       finance
          my
                   purchase
                   (in turn receiving a discount on that pair).  What do you
       say
             bitch?
