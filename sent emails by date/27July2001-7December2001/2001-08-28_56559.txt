 'Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush', Vidyadhar Date=20
 
 Enron has denied that it had approached the U.S. government in an effort to=
  obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power projec=
 t. The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursd=
 ay which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay. The repor=
 t quoted Mr Lay as saying there are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. g=
 overnment from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated =
 properties of U.S. companies. An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not dis=
 cussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush.=20
 
 Meanwhile, the legal tussle between energy activists, the Maharashtra gover=
 nment and Enron continues in India. The state government is preparing a fre=
 sh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the s=
 upreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is the lab=
 our wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and activist Abhay Meht=
 a against the Dabhol project. The affidavit will make a strong case against=
  Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP dom=
 inated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controve=
 rsial multinational.=20
 
 The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and =
 since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and =
 more evidence emerging against the project. The government will rely substa=
 ntially on the M.D. Godbole committee report which found a number of infirm=
 ities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities.=
  In the petition, CITU and Abhay Mehta, author of the book Power Play, whic=
 h gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama, have challenged the clea=
 rance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority. They argue=
 d that since the project had been renegotiated, it required a fresh review =
 by the CEA. They described as false the claim of the previous government th=
 at by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff.=

 Anti-Enron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recen=
 t setbacks received by the company. Regarding the explosion in Enron's Tees=
 ide plant in England which left three workers dead, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, ener=
 gy activist, said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for=
  the Dabhol plant.Enron suffered a serious setback last week with the resig=
 nation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, the drastic fall in stocks and =
 the explosion in the Teeside plant. Mr Kenneth Lay, the company's chairpers=
 on, is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the U.S., explaining=
  the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall St=
 reet. While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India, it is also re=
 ported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Acti=
 vists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity =
 being voiced in other parts of the world. Anti-privatisation activists inva=
 ded the legislature building in the Brazilian state of Parana last week, pr=
 otesting against the move to privatise the state's electric generation, tra=
 nsmission and distribution utility.=20
