I also probably need to ask the comp committee about these "tolerable" conflicts of interest, particularly in light of recent press coverage of Enron.  We'll discuss that this afternoon, Nancy, but I am not feeling like we should agree to any of those types of provisions.  Yikes!

 Last week Teresa was waiting to hear back from Aaron (sp) regarding the threshold and process for approval. Michelle, Tom Kalb and I have a meeting this aft with Nutech and we all , including John Thompson per his meeting request last week, need to know the steps if any that we need to take on Nutech and similar matters.Michelle/Teresa, appreciate your advice on how best to track this down.
