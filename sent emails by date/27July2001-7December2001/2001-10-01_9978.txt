 	2:30 then he will attend Steve Harris' meeting.  If you need to stay on the floor, that is no
 	problem.  I will update you.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF
