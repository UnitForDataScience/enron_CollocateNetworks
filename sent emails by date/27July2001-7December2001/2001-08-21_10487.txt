 	close.  As far as the "sum station" issue, they have it as an high priority.  He was not sure they
 	would have it fixed by August close by should have it by September close.  Raetta if you hear anything
 	different, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

 Jeff,
 
 Last month  after our Commodity close NNG has had customers calling with differences in the volumes we reported verses the volumes that Gas Measurement reported for the month of June 2001.  I think you are aware there  is a rounding issue with the volumes due to the decimals in the new PGAS system.  I don't know if this problem has been resolved or not but since July's close is quickly approaching I was wondering if you could give me the status on this problem and also if there will be adjustments made to the June volumes in PGAS to reflect the same volumes that we reported to our Customers? We appreciate all the efforts that you and Gas Measurement have made to make this transition period as smooth as possible,  thanks  for your assistance and I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
