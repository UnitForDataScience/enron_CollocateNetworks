 Would you be able to meet this afternoon (2:00) with my self and Janine Cashin to discuss the first Palo Alto invoice and what is in the system for July?  It shouldn't take very long - maybe 15-20 minutes.  Please let me know
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
  
     
 Janine,
 
 Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
