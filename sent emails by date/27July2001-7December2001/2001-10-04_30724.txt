 Tracy,
 Jim had wanted to meet with the business heads that charges us thru the corp charges to hear their business justifications and assumptions used in allocating costs to us.  I just want to check if you are doing this with Stan.  If you are, then maybe Jim can just sit in the same meeting.  Please let me know.  Thank you.
