 Thanks. I shall ask Shirley to schedule a lunch in 2-3 weeks for me and Krishna with you.
 Krishna is about to become a Daddy again in a few days; the end
 of August should work for him.

 Kim,
 
 I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages)
 and he mentioned an interview with you. 
 
 He is a very bright and capable individual and he would
 be a good fit to your group.

 P.S.  He looks better without the pony tail.
