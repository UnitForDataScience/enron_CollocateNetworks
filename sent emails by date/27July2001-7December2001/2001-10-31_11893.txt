 Bill,
 
 Our Chief Credit Officer would like to arrange a meeting tomorrow.  I would
 like to leave it to you to decide who the appropriate representatives from
 Enron should be based upon the attached file with questions we would like
 to have answered.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience when we
 can meet.  I am moving offices today and the easiest way to get in touch
 with me today will be via cell phone 713-301-5958.  I look forward to
 hearing from you shortly.  Thanks.
