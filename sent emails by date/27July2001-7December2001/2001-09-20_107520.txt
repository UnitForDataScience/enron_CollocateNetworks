 Hey, Rod (the "Dude"):
 
 Mr. Jason Williams of the Houston office has directed me to you.
 I spoke with Harvard (has an ENA ISDA Master Agreement (the "Master") in place) who is trading on EOL (and all ENA trades are confirmed under the existing Master).  Harvard executed a crude/Brent spread trade on EOL and discovered that the counterparty was ECTRIC (and not ENA).  Boy, were they surprised!  
 
 Harvard's request is whether ECTRIC can assign the trade to ENA.  Then, all of Harvard's trades would be subject to the ENA Master and could be netted.
 
 Is this a commercial issue?  Does ENA need a "Brent book" to receive this trade? 
 
 An assignment from ECTRIC to ENA would be only an "accommodation" to Harvard.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

 P.S.  I never made it to London in June.  My boyfriend's mother was in the hospital then and she died two weeks later.  My mother died a few weeks ago.  It's been a bad summer.  But, I'm taking a vacation from August 23 - 31 and will be in London (staying at the Ritz).  Maybe we can have that drink!
