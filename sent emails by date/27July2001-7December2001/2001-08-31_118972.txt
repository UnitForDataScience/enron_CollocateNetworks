I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.  Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min. after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.
