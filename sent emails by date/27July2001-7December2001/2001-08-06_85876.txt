          Gerald,
 
          I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding
 the
       message
          you
          left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition
    for
       law
          review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic
       deposit,
          so
          I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new
 clerk?
    I
          hope
          all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch
 so
    we
       can
          all
          go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want
 to
    say
          that it
          was great working with you. Write back soon.
 
          Best Regards,
 
          Majed Nachawati
