 Erica,
 
 I need to make some changes to the list of e-request approvers.  
 
 Anne Bike has left the group and I will be taking over all her requests.  Anything related to sitara and TDS for the west desk will now be my responsibility. 
 Phillip Love should now be the approver for all TDS and sitara requests related to the EAST and VNG regions.
 Scott Palmer will be responsible for TDS and sitara for Wellhead, Central and Chicago regions.
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks
 
 Kam
