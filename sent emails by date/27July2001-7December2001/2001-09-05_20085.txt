  The California Public Utilities Commission has postponed until after Sept. 11 a vote to establish how much revenue the California Department of Water Resources will receive for power purchases through 2002, a spokeswoman said.
 
 The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities since January. The CPUC decision would establish how much the CDWR could recover through rates from each utility for those power buys.
 
 The proposed decision, originally scheduled for a vote Thursday, was made available for the first time Tuesday night. The vote on the proposal was postponed in order to allow time for parties to file comments, which are due by 5 p.m. Sept. 11.
 
 A new date for a vote hasn't been set, but will occur "some time after comments are received," the CPUC said in a press release.
