 FYI:
 
 As part of the continued cleanup of the production IIS environment on the DMZ I am making some more changes. These changes are meant to secure the production environment and stabilize the server.
 
 All local admin ID's will be disabled ( except for existing service accounts)
 All web development persons should access the server with HotTap domain ID's and not local ID's
 NO PC Anywhere access will be granted except for server support personnel
 Any server changes will need to be made by the Server Support team or HotTap Support team ( ODBC settings, IIS settings, ...etc)
 
 We will make sure that all domain accounts have the permissions needed to function properly. Please let us know ASAP if you need more rights than given and we will correct it immediately.   
 
 We are also working to migrate the SQL services off of X12 by the end of the week. This should help stabilize the server and free up resources.
 
 Thanks for your help and patience.
