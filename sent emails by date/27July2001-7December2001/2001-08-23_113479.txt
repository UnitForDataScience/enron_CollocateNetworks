 Today I contacted our friends at Frontier Economics and at Tabors Caramanis about developing a set of talking points and leave-behinds for future RTO meetings (outside of the mediation process) with Governors, State Legislatures, Utility Commissioners and Members of Congress.  
  
 In order to adequately provide us with the materials we need, both firms are interested in getting a better idea of the following:
  
 
 who (which individuals) are raising concerns about the RTO Concept that FERC/Enron are advocating 
 what specifically are the arguments these critics are making against the single, mandatory RTO concept? 
 What are the priority issues that need addressing in your regions?  (We'll probably have to develop different documents depending on who we are talking with).
 
 Each of you contacted me this week about wanting to meet with various policymakers in order to address their concerns and deliver our message.  Before you schedule your meetings, I think it's important to arm you with materials that can be left behind that summarize and/or outline your arguments for a single RTO.  Your feedback is important so PLEASE send me an email by Thursday outlining the feedback you've recently received and topics that you want Frontier Economics and TC to address.
  
 Time is of the essence so please send me whatever thoughts you have so that I can forward to FE and TC.  
  
 Thanks!
