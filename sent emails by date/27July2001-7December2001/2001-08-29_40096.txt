  i liked the ve guy the other day on privacy and documents e.g.) and for you to speak as well. janette booked you for 12-1:30 so you can eat lunch and speak and duck out if you want. i will go and think will have a couple other attorneys to sprinkle around at tables (let me know if you have view or i will just do). my assistant will handle details and i will arrange speakers etc. total cost: about $1,800 (tho having pr people see if can get any cheaper...).
 
  i have revised budget for conference which i will send you within next day (waiting on one thing from woodlands re it) and the lunch will be on it as well in a second category so we can get turned in and approved. i want to send this email out on the same day as a reminder of date on the woodlands to applicable people. steve kean not available but rick shapiro/ jim steffas are. bruce lundstrum signed up with skadden lawyer. klauberg signed up with elizabeth.i  were you going to talk to evans? i have call into vicki re retail ideas.
