 Tanya,
 I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.
 
 I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.
 
 Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.
 
 How do you want to proceed?
 
 Sheila
