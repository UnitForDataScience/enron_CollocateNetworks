 Joe,
  
 I enjoyed our conversation yesterday and look forward to learning more.  Now it seems more challenging than ever to pick a spot within Enron, but I have had good conversations with several groups and it does look like some good opportunities do still exist around the organization including your shop.  As you look over my CV you will I'm sure notice that my educational background is different than the typical Enron recruit.  I think that my performance during my years within Enron and the consistent recognition I have received in PRC in some of the core operations of Enron's business should demonstrate that at this point differences in education are insignificant relative to my potential to positively contribute to the business.  I look forward to talking again soon.
 
 Regards,
 Fred
