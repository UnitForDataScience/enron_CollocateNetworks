
 
 Richard is looking into whether we can tape in Houston or Portland and have a CA person on the line.  Mark
 
    the caller (taping party) is not in California but the recipient is located
 in California.
 
 Must a statement be made that the call is being taped?  If so, are there any
 magic words?
 
 Should there be a beep or tone periodically during the conversation?
 
 Any other requirements?
 
 We would appreciate a response as soon as possible, preferably early Friday.
 
 Since I will be out of the office on Friday, please include Mike D. Smith in
 your response so that he can relay it to our business people.
 
 Thank you again for your assistance.
 
 Regards,
 
 Sarah
