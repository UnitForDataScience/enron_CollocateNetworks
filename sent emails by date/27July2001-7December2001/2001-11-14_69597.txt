 Hey Looch!!
 
 Funny e-mail.   What's the latest at Enron?   Have you heard anything
 that
 could affect your status here in the Denver office?  I sure hope
 not....unless its good news of course.
 
 Jared is done with football and has already moved onto basketball.   His
 first game was last night in Limon.   We lost 45-27 but I think his team
 has
 potential.   They should do ok.
 
 What's new with you?
