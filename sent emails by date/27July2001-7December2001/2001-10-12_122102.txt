 Would you be available on Tuesday morning for breakfast?  Otherwise, both Ron and I are available anytime in the morning.  If you had only afternoon available, I can meet with you.  Let me know what works for you.  
 
 FYI, I am sending the revised agreement to you today so that you have a chance to review it before we meet.  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
 

    
 
 Hi Kim-
 Just wanted to check the status of the TW interconnect bids for Big
 Sandy (w
 and w/o meter set, etc.).
 Hope that you are doing well.
 Best regards,
 Kirk
