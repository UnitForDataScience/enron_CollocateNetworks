 Does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on PNM?
 
 I'm very glad that this passed.  Thank you for your help!  Kim.
 
  in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.
