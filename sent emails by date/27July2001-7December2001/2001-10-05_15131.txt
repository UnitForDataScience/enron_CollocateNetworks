 In case you don't, hey what's going on?  I haven't talked with you in a long time, so I was wondering what's up with you?  How's DC?  How's PGE?  I'm doing OK.  I went to Europe in June (whole month).  Very nice.  Italy, Switzerland, France, and Netherlands.  Hard to come back.  Then I almost went to Duke, but then came to agreement with Enron.  That was interesting.  Anyway, just wanted to touch base.  Let me know what's going on.

 Hey Sean, sorry I hung up there. 
 I was hoping you could still give me Scott's number, or whoever deals
 with
 odd lot sp15. 
 Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.
