  Peter, I understand  you spoke with my dad earlier today about the possibilities of providing some  public policy representation for Enron.  Jenny Ford and I have already  begun attending meetings of the Interagency Energy Policy Work Group and  receive updates on their itinerary.  As my dad told you, this group will  have great influence over the future of the power plant moratorium in the  state.  I have several documents that explain the work group, it's  mission, and it's members that I will forward if you like.  Please feel  free to contact me with any questions or comments.  We are looking  forward to the opportunity to work with Enron.
