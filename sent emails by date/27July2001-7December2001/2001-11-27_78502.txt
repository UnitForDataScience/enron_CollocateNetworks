 What's your suggestion?  We are looking at a PA in connection with Tennessee Pipeline's open season. (did I get that right?)

 Good suggestions.  Take a look at this proposal.  I have talked with Julie Smith this morning and they are still interested in transacting with ENA despite the negative press.
 
 Thanks,
 Ruth
