 I respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.  It seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago.  So what are my options other than waiting until November 20th?

 Hi, Ben.  When you receive the information regarding Tom Martin's ESOP changes, and whether or not the appropriate people have received the information, would you please send me some kind of notification?  Please also let me know if Tom is the person who needs to call and inquire about it, as you suggested may be the case since it is handled outside of Enron.
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Laura Vuittonet
