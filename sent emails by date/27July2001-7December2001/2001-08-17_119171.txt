 Rich,
 My firm has been ask to represent Citgo in the negotiation of an ISDA Master
 Agreement with Enron.  Stuart Rains has forwarded to us the pdf files that you
 sent to him.  Please provide us with the Schedule and Paragraph 13 in a format
 that we can edit and black line or changes to.  We find that this practice helps
 speed along the process and it allows us to keep our client updated as to the
 progress of negotiations.  I look forward to working with you.
 Regards,
