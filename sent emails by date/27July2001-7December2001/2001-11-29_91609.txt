 Hey, how you doing ? Still hanging in there ? Is the snow on the mountains yet for Skiing ?
 
 Back in London slowly getting to grips with the changes that have taken place, not quite visible at first...
 
 I am working with Paul again on the Spanish desk along with Kristian and things are a little interesting in the market.
 
 Been limited to plugging things together with Excel and not much database creativity, more analysis, which is good but a bit limiting at times with the internal Police preventing flexibility !
 
 Are you in the office today, I have a question for you ?
 
 Karl.
