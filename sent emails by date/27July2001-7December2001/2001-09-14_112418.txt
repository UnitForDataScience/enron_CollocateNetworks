 Clement - On Monday I sent you a request via email and fax regarding the ne=
 ed to put in place a Enron Corp Guaranty for Enron Energy Marketing Corp.(E=
 EMC) to Southern California Edison.  This has now become very urgent, since=
  EEMC is now close to going over their current credit limit.  Please let me=
  know as soon as possible what the status is.  Thanks, Teresa
