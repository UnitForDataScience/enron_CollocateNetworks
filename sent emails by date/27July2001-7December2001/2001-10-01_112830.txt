I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif.  If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.

 Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.
 
 Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
