     As you are aware, we've let 4,000 full time tenured employees go.  Our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree.  Please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors (from the list below) in your area that you wish to retain.  Upon completion, please forward it to me.
 
 Dan
 
   there needs to be ample justification to retain.  This exercise is being done for all contractors throughout ETS.
