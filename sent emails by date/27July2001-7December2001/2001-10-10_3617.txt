 John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject system to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to automate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few power point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.
 
 It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning systems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with your own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power.
