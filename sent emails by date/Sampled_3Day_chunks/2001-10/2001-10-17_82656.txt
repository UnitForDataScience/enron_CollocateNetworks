 I'll let you know what I find out.
 
  

 

 
 
                      
       Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
       extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
    report
       card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
       sickness.
       I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but
    she
       still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
       4th
       grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up
    in
       prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
    she's
       dumb
       and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
    letter
       last
       night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
       not.
       She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt
    me
       so
       bad.
 
       Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
       best
       thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.
 
       How's the school search going for Jordan?
