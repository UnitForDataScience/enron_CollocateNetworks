 Errol- A swap between Enron and Tudor for Cal02 at 4.70 must be booked as soon as we figure out that there is no possibility it is in the system.
  
 Derek/Michelle- this deal not being included in the system should be throwing off Ospraie's MTM.  This swap is at 4.70.. they are short 60 contracts..currently Cal02 is around $3.. which should result in $1M more positive P&L for Ospraie and $1M less for us.  
  
 This must be settled first thing Monday.
