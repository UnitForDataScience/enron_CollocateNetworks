 We have found some good info on tissue paper from an independent consulting company.I talked to Andrea so we are going to go and purchase the study. The consulting company is located in Germany and the name of the person and his contact are:
 
 Esko Uutella
 phone 49815129193

 
 Please read below for the kind of information he can provide us with and the related costs. We decided to get the whole package.
 thanks,
 Monika
 
 
 

    
 
 Hi Ms. Causholli,
 
 I have made recently a major multiclient study "Outlook for World Tissue 
 Business" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
 capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
 study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
 detailed Annexes).
 
 If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
 the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
 600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
 could easier fulfil your data needs.
 
 
 Best regards
 
 Esko Uutela
