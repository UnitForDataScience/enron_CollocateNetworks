 We are attempting to determine the total cost of risk for Enron which necessitates gathering information from the Enron entities that place their own insurance. We need to have information broken down on your individual programs as well as for project specific programs which you place. We would like a complete schedule to include the following:
 
 ?	type of coverage,
 ?	limits,
 ?	deductibles / retentions,
 ?	premiums.
 
 We assume that you have this information and can forward in short order. Unfortunately due to the short timeline, please forward no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
 Please call me at 713-853-7904 should you have any questions.
 
 Regards,
 
 Paul
