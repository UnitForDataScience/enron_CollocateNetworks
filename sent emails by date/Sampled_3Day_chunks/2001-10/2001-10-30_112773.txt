 Let's discuss next week in Houston.

 is this the "we don't think there is enough wholesale competition in AZ to
 allow retail competition to occur, so we "are willing" to let the retail
 customers in AZ to buy our merchant plants with an 11% return" filing?  I
 am not involved , but I understand we have a  high level group that is
 working on a response to APS' ludicrous filing and will be lobbying at the
 ACC and AZ legislature on this one.  It is simply uncomprehensible how APS
 could think that it makes sense to make such a filing in the same state
 whose commission staff seems to think that there is too much merchant
 generation being built.

 Dan,
 
 Are you familar with this document?  I have just gottne a copy and it
 proves how much contempt APS has for deregulation.  Some of the
 statements this document contain are unbelievable...If you have any
 insights to this I'd be interested in talking to you about this.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
 
 P.S., I hope all went well with your surgery.
