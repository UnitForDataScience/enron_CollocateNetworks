  Attached is the rental application. Our plans are taking shape for the trip to Wintergreen.  My sister will be flying into Dullus Thursday night and will head for Charlottesville.  Could she pick the keys up Thursday evening around 8:30 or 9pm and drop off a check at that time? She plans to stay in a hotel Thursday night, but will be the first to arrive at the house on Friday. 
 Several questions -   Could you e-mail me directions to your house and to the house in Wintergreen?  I am planning on giving you two checks-  one for $500. for the three nights and one for $150.00 for the deposit. Is that correct? Does Wintergreen have a pool and or a clubhouse of any sort that serves lunch or dinner?  Is there a grill at the house. 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
