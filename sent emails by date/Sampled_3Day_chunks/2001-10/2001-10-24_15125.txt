 Hey,
 
 You sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.
 
 Our stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.
 
 Enough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities

    
 
 Hey Sean, sorry I hung up there. 
 I was hoping you could still give me Scott's number, or whoever deals
 with
 odd lot sp15. 
 Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.
