 NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) is in an adva=
 nced stage of negotiations to sell its Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., at a =
 30% discount to financial institutions at a price likely between $700 milli=
 on-$800 million, reports the Economic Times, quoting unnamed sources.=20
 
 The business daily says Enron and the financial institutions, led by the In=
 dustrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), are close to finalizing a broad=
  agreement within the next few days. The final settlement should be worked =
 out before Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the U.S. i=
 n the second week of November, according to the report.
 
 Should the deal go through, Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payme=
 nt plan in equal instalments to minimize a heavy one-time foreign exchange =
 transfer, says the report.=20
 
 Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian stat=
 e of Maharashtra. Enron holds a 65% stake in DPC. Costing $2.9 billion, the=
  project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.=20
