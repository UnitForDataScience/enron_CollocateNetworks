I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.    Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.   I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.    Especially at the top.

 Lisa,
 
 Attached is the Spend/Approvals amounts for the new HR job groups that have recently been created and the most recent HR structure file that I received from Lessa Hutcherson in HR.  I inserted in red the Spend/Approval amounts that we discussed for the new groups.  Currently we have no employees in any of these new groups.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks
 
 Jeff
