 Is Enron disputing the fair value of $41.9 million already disclosed as

 Attached is a red line version and "clean" version of proposed EGP Fuels
 responses to the EOTT SEC request.
 
 Bob - I assume you will also review this w Mr Causey
 Tom - Item # 18 on affiliated revenues requires additional data, that I
 believe you have on file.
 All - Item #17 on Morgan's Point tax valuation should be reviewed
 closely.
