 ChoKoNu mayhem was the deciding factor.
 At one point, Beth and I soaked the earth with the blood of wave after wave of paladin assault
 (and rear-action monk cowards), but it was Alan's resource control that won out.
 But for the most part, I would characterize the game as a draw.
 Bring on the firstperson shooters until Star Wars.

  Let's gauge the interest in a first-person shooter: 
 Through Allan, we have several at our disposal, and if we want to own them, there are a ton of great ones available at sub-basement prices.  However, let's try before we buy (if you haven't already).  Current options include Rogue Spear (very realistic and detailed), Quake (fragtastic), and Tribes (all about teamwork).  There are others, too, but these were the ones Allan and I were chatting about.
 You folks wanna try this?

 PS. Allan said he was awake all night thinking about how close we came to slaughtering him..or something to that affect.
