 Dear Ted,
 
 We are all set for the metals doorstep to be performed the week of Nov. 5th with the exception of a name for the RAC resource.  We are starting to plan the review and would like to involve RAC.  Who have you designated as the RAC resource (Brenda Herod from Operations will be the person responsible from the operations side)?  
 
 I'd like to get Brenda and RAC together some time this week if possible.
 
 Thanks!
