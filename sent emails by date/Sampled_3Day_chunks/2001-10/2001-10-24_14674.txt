 Shelley,
 I'm sure she already thinks I'm difficult. I'm pretty sure the Kaz government 
 sets the court date after your dossier is registered  there. So, if our 
 paperwork is not there yet, then how can she know that our court date will be 
 in the time frame she thinks it is?
 The more I try to understand everything she had told me the more confused I 
 get sometimes. It's really hard not understanding and being in on everything 
 involved in the process.
 I don't know if she even knows how long the paper work will take. Chris told 
 me, when I sent mine in 5 weeks ago, that the estimate was 2 weeks for 
 translation, 2 weeks for the Kaz embassy, 2 weeks to be sent to Kaz and 
 registered. As of Monday mine is still in translation.
 I really don't know what to do right now. Should we just wait until the first 
 of next week and call again and find out the status of everything?
