 I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
  
 Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.
  
  
  
  
 
 
     
 
 I think we have 3 that are on my list and not on yours.  We have big differences in order.  I'm very concerned about this process.  I'll send you dave's email and you might understand why.
  
 Call me or resend me an email.
