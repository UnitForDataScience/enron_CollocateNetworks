       Sara, I had already begun to look into this so I can take care of
 it.

                           AM                       Master
       Agreement
                                                   for Cargill
    International,
       S.A.
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Dear Sara & Cheryl,
 
       I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
       International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
       them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.
 
       There had been some question as to which Enron entity
       was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
       information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
       office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
       & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
       International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.
 
       Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
       confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
       whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
       also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
       done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
       get this ISDA started on Enron's part.
 
       Thanks and Regards,
