 Kate,
 It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times. Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it. We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.
 I appreciate your understanding.
 
 Bill
  
     
 Bill -
 
 What would you think about me taking off next Thursday and Friday? If that doesn't work, perhaps the following Monday and Tuesday? Let me know.
