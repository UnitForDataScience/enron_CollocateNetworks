
 
 Keith,
 I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these
 respective meters on NWPL:
 
 Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472
 Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446
 Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227
 Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302
 
 Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not
 nominate through the Cascade LDC?
 This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.
 
 Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the
 above plants closed or reduced capacity.
 
 I appreciate any help you can give me.
 Thanks,

 Ms. Ridinger:
 
 I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
 States
 and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
 the
 Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
 which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
 the DRNs
 for the other three.
 If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
 I would
 greatly appreciate it.
 
 Thanks,
