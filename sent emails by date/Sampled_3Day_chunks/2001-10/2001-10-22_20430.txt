   Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of $4.3 billion that =
 California got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering. (If t=
 his loan is not repaid by November 1, its interest rate jumps to 7% from 4%=
 , resulting in an extra $250,000 in interest payments a day.)=20
 Whether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers, or s=
 ome combination of the two, the impact on California's economy and its budg=
 et will be dreadful. Observers are estimating a budget deficit of almost $1=
 0 billion for next year.=20
 As for Governor Davis, the problems of the "previous administration" are no=
 w his own. And Californians know it. A recent statewide poll showed that mo=
 st voters preferred the former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, the l=
 eading Republican challenger to Mr. Davis, by several points.=20
 The Governor's response to the ever-worsening economic situation has been t=
 ypical. He complains. He vetoes a few spending bills. He announces a $5 mil=
 lion campaign to persuade Californians to help the local economy by staying=
  in-state for their vacations. We expect to see a lot of chickens on surfbo=
 ards.
