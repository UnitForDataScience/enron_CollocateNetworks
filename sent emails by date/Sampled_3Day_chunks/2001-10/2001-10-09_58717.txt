 Ken, Greg and Mark:
 
 Our next all-employee is scheduled for Oct. 23 at 10 a.m at the Hyatt Regency Houston.  Steve Kean asked me send you a reminder about the meeting and for you to be thinking about messages for both our investors and our employees.  This will help when compiling the presentation slides.  
 
 Also, please let me know if all of you plant to participate in giving the presentation.  Thanks.
