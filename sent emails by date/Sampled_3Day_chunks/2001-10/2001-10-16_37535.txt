       Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be
    a
       little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon
       works
       best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest
    somewhere
       around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
       Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese
    place
       in 2
       Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.
