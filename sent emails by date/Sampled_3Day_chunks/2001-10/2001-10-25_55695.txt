 may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7
 p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you
 would agree to be on the Committee.
 
 	We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance
 for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any
 suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.
 
 Best wishes,
 
 Praveen
