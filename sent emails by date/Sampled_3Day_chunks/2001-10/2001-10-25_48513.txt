 Mark Greenberg asked me to check with you to see if Enron Corp. ever got Confidentiality Agreements in place with either True Exchange or BizBots?  Can you please let me know.  Thanks!
  
     
 Do you have copies of any of the following NDAs?
 
 At the Moment - yes, expired
 True Exchange - no, never had one
 BizBots - no, never had one
