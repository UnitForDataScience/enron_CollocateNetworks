 Jeane, I have evidence on some DA bills where SCE has assessed late fees on
 disputed bills.  I haven't been able to do a thorough analysis, but knowing
 the amount we have disputed so far, the charges could be substantial.
 
 I understood that, until the CPUC makes a decision, the UDC can not charge
 late fees on disputed bills.  Correct?
