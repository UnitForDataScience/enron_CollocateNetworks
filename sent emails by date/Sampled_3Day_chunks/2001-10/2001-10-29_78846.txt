 I would like to go ahead and request some days off for the upcoming holidays, if it is still possible.
 
 Wed, October 31st
 Wed, November 21st

 I realized how much vacation I have remaining, and I might as well see if I can get off these days if there's coverage.  I guess just let me know how it all turns out.
