 We should have no problem with the pass through of congestion in Texas.  The QSE receives a charge for our entire load and then allocates it to our load of a pro rata basis.  We then pass through these costs to the customer.  This is the same way we do things in the NE and the only way we can pass through intrazonal congestion.  If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call at 33143. Thanks.
