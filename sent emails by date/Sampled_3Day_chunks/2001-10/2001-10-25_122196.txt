 Kirk,
 
 As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point
 Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will
 have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and
 I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let
 me know if you would like to book a telephone conference call Wednesday,
 Thursday or Friday.  
 
 Have a nice weekend and safe travel to Houston!
 
 Thanks, 
 
 Kim
