 Hope this helps.
 
 1)  Only the power positions need to be queried.  Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench.
 
 2)  Any power Exchange transactions should be included, but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey

 Hi Norman. I've tried running some queries using Adhoc and I always get too detailed information. We only need total MONTHLY peak and off-peak positions for a couple of portfolios.
 
 I've attached a file to illustrate the information we need. Can you please take a quick look and let me know if it would be possible to write a query to generate the info on a daily basis. Since the query may take a while to run, and we need the info by 7:00AM everyday, I would prefer to automatically run the query at say 5AM?
 
 Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.
 - Tom
