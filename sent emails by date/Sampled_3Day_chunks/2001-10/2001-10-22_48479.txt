 Hi Mom,
 I hope you got your package by now.  I found my receipt from the post
 office the other day just in case I need it.  I attached a powerpoint
 presentation a friend sent me.  It is pretty good. It takes a few
 seconds to load up so be patient.  Let me know if you received you
 package.  Eric
