 Brian:
 I met with Devon last week and it looks like the deal will close November
 15th or Dec 1st. If we are able to agree on a position at Enron, the
 earliest I could be available would be December 1st, if the deal closed on
 schedule, the latest would be January 4th taking in consideration of the
 Christmas Holidays. Brian at your convenience I would like to visit your
 office and see your operations and meet Tom.  I will be available Thursday
 and Friday of this week or the week of October 15th.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Bill
