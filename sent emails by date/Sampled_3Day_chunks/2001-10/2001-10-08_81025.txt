 I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.
 
 Good luck with the rest of the season.

 Have a safe trip and don't get in too much trouble tonight.
 
 Good luck to you guys.  I hope the game is a good as the hype.
 
 Again, I can't wait.  It is such a great spectacle.
