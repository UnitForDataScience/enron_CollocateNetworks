 Sacramento  will shift higher costs to smaller customers. 
 
 The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. 
 
 "What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. 
 
 He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. 
 
 But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. 
 
 She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.
