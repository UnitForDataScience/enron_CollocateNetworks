 Joe,
 I have a couple questions.
 1. Why is she looking for a new job?
 2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
 why?
 
 Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
 convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
 Love,
 Mom
 I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
 night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
 told her you would see her on Friday.
