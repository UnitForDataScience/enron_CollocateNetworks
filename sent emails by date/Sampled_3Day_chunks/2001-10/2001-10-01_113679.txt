             Dear Joe,
 
             Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at
       about
          3:00
             p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you
       could
             come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for
    my
          son's
             soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for
          you???
