
 
 Thanks.
 
 

    
 
 Thanks, I have staff calling Snezak. Will wait to hear from you on financial folks.
 

 Kevin:
 
 It was good to meet you yesterday.  I decided to watch the Commission
 meeting on television so I wasn't at FERC today, but I wanted to pass on
 this information to you about possible panelists for the November 2
 Infrastructure Meeting in Seattle.
 
 From Governor Geringer's office, a staff level person is Steve Reynolds
 (Wyoming Business Council, also staffs the Wyoming Energy Council).  
 

 Steve is great, pro-RTO, pro-economic development.  
 
 Lt. Governor Ohs (Montana) or Steve Snezak.  The Lt. Governor runs
 Economic Development for the State.  
 
     Steve is the Lt. Gov.'s Chief Policy Aide.  406.444.3111.   
 
     Both Wyoming and Montana are pro-RTO.  
 
 Other options:  Governor Leavitt is pro-infrastructure development, but
 probably not a strong RTO supporter.  
 
         Jeff Burke (State of Utah Energy Office) is probably the
 contact in Utah for this matter if you want a staff person.  
 
         His contact information is:  (801) 538-5428.

 
 We are still looking for names to represent the financial industry.  I
 will let you know what we find out.  Please let me know if you have
 questions.
