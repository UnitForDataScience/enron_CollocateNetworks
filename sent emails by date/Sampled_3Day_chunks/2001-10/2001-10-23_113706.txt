    Dear Joe:
 
    I just received a phone call from Miryam  Mitchell.  She said if you
    would like to take Payton to Vero Beach on  Saturday, November 3rd, you
    may have him from 12:00 to 7:00, if you are willing  to forego
    visitation on Sunday and let Tonya have him all day on  Sunday.
 
    If you'd prefer this, let me know.  It  is your call.
