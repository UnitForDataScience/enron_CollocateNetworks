 Please find the latest draft of the RTO slide for inclusion in next week's 3Q Analyst Conference Pitchbook. Greg Whalley will be presenting the Wholesale Section which will include a brief RTO's discussion.
 
 Please take a minute and review and let me know if you have any comments/concerns with the wording. 
 
 Kind Regards.
