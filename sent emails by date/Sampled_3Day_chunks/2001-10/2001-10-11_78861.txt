 We have not heard of this guy.  It looks like his most recent experience has been managing Coastal's refinery gas supply activities.  Unfortunately the people who have the most history with industrial and refinery gas buyers went with the HPL sale.

 Don,
 
 I forwarding the resume of David Horacefield.  I was wondering if you were interested in talking to this candidate as a potential replacement for Roger Reynolds.  He has good Texas Natural Gas knowledge.
 
 Let me know.
 
 Regards,
 Todd Peikert
