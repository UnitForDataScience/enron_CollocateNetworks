 $1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.
 
 If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks!
