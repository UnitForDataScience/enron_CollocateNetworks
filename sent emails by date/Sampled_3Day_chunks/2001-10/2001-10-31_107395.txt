 Dear John:
 
 As discussed, we have exposures under Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp.
 and Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.   We would like to enter into a netting
 agreement with each of the Enron entities.
 
 Today, we executed a netting agreement with your London entity, Enron
 Capital & Trade Resources Ltd.   Enclosed please find the proposed
 netting agreements for these two Enron entities based on your UK
 entity's form of netting agreement.
 
 Please review and provide us with your comments by Monday.
 
 Kind regards,
 MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC.
