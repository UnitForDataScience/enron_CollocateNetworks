 Hi, Steve.  I hope all is well. 
 
 Jeff wanted me to ask you about Wallis Jefferson.  Apparently, he's running 
 for Texas Supreme Court and he wanted to know if this guy "lives the 
 values," so to speak.  He hasn't called him yet, but just wanted your 
 perspective on him when you have a chance. 
 
 Jeff is traveling at the moment, but you can e-mail me or Jeff directly at 

 
 Thanks for your help.  SRS
