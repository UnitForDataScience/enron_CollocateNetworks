 Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.  I'm sure you were glad just to get home and relax.
 
 
 
 

 
  
 It was really fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.  It was great to get
 to play together.  I'll get Scott a check for our share of the goodies.
 Thanks again.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
