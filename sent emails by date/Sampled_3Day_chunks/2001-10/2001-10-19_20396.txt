 This and the following two e-mails contain the updated information requested
 by ALJ Wetzell in his Ruling dated August 15, 2001.  The documents are
 spread out over three e-mails because they consist primarily of
 spreadsheets.   In this first e-mail SDG&E attaches its pleading responding
 to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling along with two documents providing the assumptions
 SDG&E used for its updates to Exhibits 14 and 18 and  a document providing a
 summary of all of SDG&E's updated analyses.  In the second e-mail SDG&E will
 provide its updates to Exhibit 14 and in the third e-mail SDG&E will provide
 its updates to Exhibit 18.
