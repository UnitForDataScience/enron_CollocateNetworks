 a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like enough of a princess to
 take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway of however many
 pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would really show how much
 things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me.
 We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full.
 I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.

 Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we go.
 And I think of you as my partner every day, and I'm sorry I take it for granted.
 
   

 
  I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your 
 criticisms. 
 By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin. 
 Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite 
 our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
 Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common 
 interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a 
 pact 
 to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave 
 Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul. 
 Love, 
 Jason 
 P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me, 
 and vice versa.
