 I think we may be past due on when we need to play by, but thats fine.  I think Saturday works for me as well.  I know things are quite busy right now, so good luck with everything.

 It looks like we are playing eachother in the Met's consolation round.  The best time I can play is either after work or some time on the weekend.  Let me know what works for you.
