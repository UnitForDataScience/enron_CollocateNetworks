 Folks:
 
 Attached please find Rev 5 of the site list. I've added the Onondaga Gas
 Transport Agreement to the list, and Kay's name to certain development
 projects given her extensive history with these projects.
 
 Please use this as a source document to replace the prior version. Fred,
 please provide a copy of the transport agreement to Kathleen, and let me
 know which Enron entity is the counterparty to OCLP.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben
