 Please pull the following info and put into Excel:
 
 BU = EA
 Peer Group = Commercial
 EE Status = Active or LOA
 
 List all EEs, sorted by:
 	1)  Job Title (high level to low level)
 	2)  EE's Name (alpha order)
 
 Be sure to include the following info, if the EE is on an ACTIVE, EXECUTABLE EE Agrmt:
 	EE Agrmt Begin Date
 	EE Agrmt End Date
