 Mike Indivero has scheduled for his Team.  They have allotted
 approximately 30 -  45 minutes to help us introduce ourselves to the
 team.  Mike and I had briefly discussed using the time to explain the
 subject matter expertise and services that OLER is prepared to provide.
 You indicated that you would use the opportunity to go out to Seattle,
 given that I had contemplated using vacation on August  1& 2.  I can
 easily alter my vacation dates and attend if the trip fails to
 compliment your work / travel schedule.   Mike Indivero has a widely
 dispersed HR organization and they face many challenges unique to the
 merit shop / construction world.  I'm sure they will enjoy the
 opportunity to meet you.
