 I forgot one thing.  Let Morgan and I know if you get any declines for our session.  
 
 Thanks, Kim. 
 
  
     When:	Wednesday, August 08, 2001 8:00 AM-7:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
 Where:	Four Seasons Hotel (Downtown)
 
 I will be there!
 
 Sasha,
 
 I did not see TK Lohman or Tracey Geaconne on the distribution list.  Would you please make sure they get an invite.  Also, would you copy Steve Harris on this invitation even though I know he will be out of town on this date.  
 
 Thanks for your help.  Kim.
