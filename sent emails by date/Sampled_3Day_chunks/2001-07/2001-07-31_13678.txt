 Stan Farmer and I have been working per your request on the compensation is=
 sue related to leaves of absence.  We need further legal clarification rega=
 rding one point before we can properly assess the situation you described i=
 n your previous e-mail. =20
 
 When you state, "It is also assumed that employees on unpaid leaves maintai=
 n their "active" employment status," we need to know the manner in which yo=
 u are defining an active employee.  For purposes of evaluation under FIN 44=
 , the definition of an employee is a person under common law as illustrated=
  under US Internal Revenue Ruling 87-41 potentially subject to US payroll t=
 axes as an employee of the grantor of the options.  During the leave of abs=
 ence, does the grantee continue to meet the definition of an employee under=
  this statute?=20
 
 We need a legal opinion as to employee qualification under the Revenue Ruli=
 ng above before we can further investigate proper accounting procedure.  As=
  soon as we receive your response we will continue our research and provide=
  you with the requested guidance in a timely manner.
 
 Thanks for your assistance.
