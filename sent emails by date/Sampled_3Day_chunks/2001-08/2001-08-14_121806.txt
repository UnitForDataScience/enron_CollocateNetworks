 Are we getting a portion of the 49C2 conference video?  We are getting something from one of the video rooms.  any ideas?
  
 Thanks, Kim.
 
     
 
 Audrey, as far as I know, TW is not presently being charged for the Marketing Video Conference room.  Dana could probably tell you more but we were under the impression that it was all being charged to NNG.  If you do not get this resolved with Dana, let me know and I will do some additional research on it.
  
 Talk to you tomorrow.
