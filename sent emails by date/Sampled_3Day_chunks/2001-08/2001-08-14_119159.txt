 Dear Mr. Hermans:
 The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
 August 6.
 
 1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
 Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
 contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
 exchanges in the trading of physical metal?
 
 2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
 brings to the steel industry?
 
 3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
 creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?
 
 4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?
 
 5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
 agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
 traded on-line?
 
 Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.
