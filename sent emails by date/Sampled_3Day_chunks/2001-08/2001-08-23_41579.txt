We don't want to enter into an ISDA with an agency arrangement as it poses problems as far as netting and other matters.  Brent will call Todd and tell him that we will either enter into 6 separate masters or one master with Southern and then they can internally back to back trades.  So, I would not do anything until Brent speaks with you and Todd.
