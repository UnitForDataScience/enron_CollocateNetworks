 I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes).  
 
 Let me know if there is anything else.

 78XX, the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison.
 For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen, the Governor and the
 Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison.  Here
 are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it:
 
 1) The state would securitize $2.9 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its
 debts.  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or
 more in peak daily demand.  That would translate to about 0.06 (as in
 6/100ths) of a penny per kW.  The original proposal was to place the
 bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand, which would
 have been maybe 1.5 cents per kW (since the base would have been much
 smaller), but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW.
 
 2) The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable.  That means that Edison
 customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or
 from a DA contractor.  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the
 Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying!
 
 3) The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand (load) which
 exceeds supply as calculated as follows: DWR contracts + IOU retained
 generation + IOU long term contracts.  If this delta, or headroom exists as
 of 1/1/03, then, per PUC regs,which are yet to be devloped, the Calif.
 Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount
 of headroom, without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee.  (An
 exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a
 customer for the customer's proportional share of the state's stranded
 costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR, but for which there
 is no market.)  If no headroom exists, a customer still could go DA, but
 pay the exit fee to do so.
 
 4) A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended.
 Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to
 1/17/01 to continue without penalty.  It looks like contracts signed
 between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty,
 but that date is not definite.  Contracts signed between June and August
 24th would also be permitted, but may have to pay some sort of retroactive
 exit fee, on a sliding scale, depending on the date they were signed.  All
 DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1/1/03 schedule
 described in #3 above.
 
 In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers, and exit fees for
 DA customers when no headroom exists, there will be another surcharge for
 all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since
 January 17th.  That surcharge would be to payoff $13 billiion in state
 revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR
 bought since January.
 
 Where does BOMA, and the rest of the business community stand on these
 issues?
 
 1) BOMA has been O.K. with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric
 customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan. 17,
 when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market
 power.
 
 2) While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR
 long term contracts, we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for
 them, and wants to be held harmless for their costs.  BOMA and other
 business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated
 or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without
 exit fees.
 
 3) BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any
 surplus electricity revenues after the first $500 million to ratepayers
 based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate
 payments.  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on
 customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50% in the last
 few months.
 
 4) Finally, BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison.  But the
 Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone
 he can see, including all business groups, to help get it enacted.  In that
 light, BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers, residential as well
 as business pay the debt.  The legislature, however, did not want to pass
 this cost on to residential customers, so then it became a fight over where
 the consumer threshold would be.  As stated above, we have suceeded in
 getting it as low as 20kW peak demand.  (NOTE:  There are those that feel
 it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to
 get the state out of the energy business.  You can decide for yourselves.)
 
 5) It should also be noted that the Edison, bond and DWR surcharges may all
 be covered in the existing rates you are now paying.  That is to say that
 there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since
 the market price for power has come down substantially.  But this remains
 to be seen.
 
 There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes.  The
 committee is going back in at 6:30 this evening and we will see what
 happens.  I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation.
