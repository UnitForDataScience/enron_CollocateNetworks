 otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor=
 t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France," commented Carsten H=
 aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a=
 nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el=
 ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran=
 sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after =
 Ruhrgas. "This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, =
 especially in East Germany, " said Haack. "But more importantly, this deal =
 will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo=
 mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network =
 operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!" he added.

 Enron's Northernmost Partner!
 Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger =
 Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Var=
 anger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partne=
 rship will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and=
  the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperat=
 ure risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to =
 develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian mar=
 ket generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second=
  such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.
 
 This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationshi=
 ps in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varange=
 r has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As =
 the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in coop=
 eration with Russian partners to manage the water storage.=20
