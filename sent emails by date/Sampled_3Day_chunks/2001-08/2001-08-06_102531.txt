Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.  It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver.
 
 The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We also hit "the Bite" which was really neat.
 
 Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.
 
 Thanks again for everything,
 Susan
 
  

             
 
    Hi Bonnie,
 
    How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
 have
    been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
 riding
    public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
 have
    some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
 One
    of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
 in
    your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
    still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
    like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
    for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
    offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
 live
    in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
 a
    research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
 for
    restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
    maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.
 
    Thanks a bunch,
    Susan
