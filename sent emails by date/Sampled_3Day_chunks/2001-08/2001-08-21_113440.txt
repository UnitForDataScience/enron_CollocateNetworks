 Guys:
 
 Attached is the latest draft, which incorporates dave's edits.  I have forwarded a copy of this draft to Coral as well, to see if they would like to join on.  I have attached this draft in WordPerfect  because we are having a little trouble over here at Bracewell converting documents from WordPerfect to Word.  If you have any trouble opening this document, please let me know.
