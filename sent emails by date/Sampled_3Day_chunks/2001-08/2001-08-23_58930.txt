 "There are big questions about FERC's role, who will determine transmission-line charges, should there be federal [authority] to site power lines, should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability," said Rep. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
 Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith, who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, noted that her state's three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines "without our approval."
 Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon. Smith noted that 60 percent of the state's power comes from hydroelectric dams. "That's public property," she said.
 In Alabama, James Sullivan, a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Co.'s affiliate, said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding.
 "I'm opposed to any [changes to] our electric system in Alabama until I know it's going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us," he said.
 In the view of Southern Co. Chairman Franklin, it is still an "open question" whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires.
 Nonetheless, the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to "put the genie back in the bottle," according to a former FERC official.
 The power merchants readily concur.
 "Everybody's paying too much because you've got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities," Enron's Presto said.
