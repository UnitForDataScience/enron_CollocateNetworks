 Virginia,
 
 All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW. Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.
 
 Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).
 
 ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.
 
 All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.
 
 If you have questions, just let me know.
 Thanks,
 Bill
