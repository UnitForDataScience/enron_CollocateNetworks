 Have we put the updated netting language in the contract?  Would it ever come into play?

 Mark/Peter - Attached hereto is an Electricity Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Enron Canada Corp. would sell power to Domtar Inc.  The agreement is in the form that we have been using for deals back-to-backed with the British Energy position (similar to the Ivaco, Atlantic Packaging, TransCanada and Sunoco agreements). Please let me know if you have any questions with respect to the agreement.  We hope to be in a position to execute within a week.
 
 Peter, we have discussed this agreement and the modifications required to take into account the revisions in the British Energy deal.  The only other changes that I have made are simple modifications to take into account Domtar's request for multiple delivery points (some of which are behind LDCs but still considered wholesale as they are registered with the IMO).
 
 Regards
 Christopher J. Gaffney
