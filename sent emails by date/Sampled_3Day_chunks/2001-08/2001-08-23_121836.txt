 Hi Guys!
 We're having a small amount of trouble finding a hotel in Rome on the front 
 end.  So I'm going to ratchet the price level up somewhat.  If anyone has a 
 problem with that - let me know.  (But be aware, you will be asked to name 
 that tune and make the long distance phone calls.)
 Also - to Paul and Judy - the Sheraton near the airport was full for the 
 tailend of the trip.  So I'm still looking for something near the airport 
 for October 11 for the 4 of us.
 Also - to Kim - will send passport #'s later.  I haven't been by the bank to
 
 pick up Dennis' passport yet.
 Talk to you later,
 Janell
