 Shirley, please keep me posted on Krishna's new baby.  Thanks, K.
 
  
     
 Kim,
 
 I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages)
 and he mentioned an interview with you. 
 
 He is a very bright and capable individual and he would
 be a good fit to your group.

 P.S.  He looks better without the pony tail.
