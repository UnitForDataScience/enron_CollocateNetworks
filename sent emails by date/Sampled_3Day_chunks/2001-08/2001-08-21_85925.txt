 I spoke with Lisa Herman late Thursday and proposed the multi-product/mulit-affiliate grty. She seemed excited and "encouraged," but wanted an additional entity added, Duke Energy Field Services, LP.  This entity will only comduct PHYSICAL business. Let mw know what I can do to help speed along the process.
