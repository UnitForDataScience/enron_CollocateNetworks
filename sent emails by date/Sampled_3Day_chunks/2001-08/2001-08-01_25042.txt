 The guy who ran our trading operation in Calgary really wanted to move back to Houston because his girlfriend lives hear so that left a hole in our Calgary trading operation so they asked me to come back. See you in a couple of weeks.

 Chris,
 
 No, I hadn't heard, but from my end, selfishly, that's great news!  What
 happened, because last I heard from your mom, you had signed on for 2 or 3
 (poor memory on my part) years in Houston.  We should arrange some golf
 while you're back if there's time.  I'll give you a call next week to touch
 base...I'm going to Panorama for a few days with Cari tonight, but will be
 back next Tuesday.
 
 Talk to you later,
 Rye
