 I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing
 earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably
 is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is
 14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average
 of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a
 $2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are
 going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which
 would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to
 wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then
 maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from
 trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or
 more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the
 bottom.
