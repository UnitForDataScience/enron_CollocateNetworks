 Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.  Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.  Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months.  Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity.  The assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of Newco.  How does that impact the question below?
 
 Thanks!
 
 Michelle

 I am working with Jeanie Slone on the Bridgeline rollover.  In working on the 401K plan, I need to know whether the Texaco/Enron employees will be treated as Terminated or will they fall under the Same Desk Rule. 
 
 Thanks,
