 Cadwalader confirms their opinion that margin postings under the netting arrangement (inclusive of forwards and derivatives) are excepted from preference provisions and that this should not be altered merely by having an insider position, absent other claims.  I have touched base with Tribolet and Sanders to let them know that Cadwalader is available to discuss the netting agreement/bankruptcy issues as desired.
