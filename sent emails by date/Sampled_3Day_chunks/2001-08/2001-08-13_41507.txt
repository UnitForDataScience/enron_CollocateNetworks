 Tana said I should forward this e-mail to you and that you guys would prepare the assignment and send to us for review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Please note that all of the deals, with the exception of the first one, are EOL deals.
 
 Thanks for your help.

  all deals were confirmed under GTC's.  Please give me a call if you need any other info.
 
 Thanks again,
