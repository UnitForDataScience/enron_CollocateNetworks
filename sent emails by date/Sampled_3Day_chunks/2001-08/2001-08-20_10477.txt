 Dear Alfredo,
 a tentative schedule for the visit to Northern (or other major pipeline) would be for me the 23 and 24 of August (Thursday and Friday).
 Alternatively, the 20 and 21 of August (Monday and Tuesday of the same week).
 I will be on holiday for the next two weeks.
 You can contact me on the usual e-mail.
 I'm not completely sure of the access from a remote site, so please note also my personal e-mail:

 and GSM +39 348 5175095
 Thank you for the assistance, and best regards
 Mauro
