 Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.   We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.
 
 Am I making sense?   In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).   We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.
 
 With respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage.
