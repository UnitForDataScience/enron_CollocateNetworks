The reporters asked several questions on the eminent domain....both Vilsack and Keating again stated that they wanted to see if states could get the job done and if not, they were open to further discussions with the feds.
 
 I'll be here thru tomorrow.  Page me or leave me a voice mail if you want to discuss in more detail.
