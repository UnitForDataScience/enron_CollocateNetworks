 Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
 As you can imagine, after Jeff Skilling's resignation,
 Greg Whalley will be tied up in a few additional stock analysts' presentations.
 
 We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine
 and would like very much to meet and exchange opinions with you.
 
 Please, advise me about your availability during the next 2 - 3 weeks. Hopefully, we
 can reconcile our schedules and meet soon.
 
 Vince
 
 
  

    
 Vince,
 
    August 16 would work for me.  Dinner or meeting
 at my office would also work.  Let me know what you'd
 like to do.
 
 Frank
