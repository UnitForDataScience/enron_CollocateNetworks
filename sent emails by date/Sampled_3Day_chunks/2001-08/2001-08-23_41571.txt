 Friday would be great for us, as long as it's not going to put you in a bind since you are trying to get out for vacation.  Also, yes, I would like to look at your catalog.  I'm so glad we're bosom buddies!
 
 We will offer our painting services to you if you want to do a faux finish at your new home.

 Hi, Robbi!
 
 Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.  How are things going now that Lance and Carol are there?  Hopefully, better.  Mark gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.  Kristina managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, Mark  saw right through them.
 
 Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.  We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.  If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.  We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.  Would you let me know?
 
 Also, we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane.  What is best for you?
 
 Talk to you later.
