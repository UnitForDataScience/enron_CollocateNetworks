 we often trade with EPMI, as they may be the best bid on any given day.      So,   the language should apply.
 
 Thx,

 This is the confirmation for the fixed price deals, containing the newly revised language.  Please review and let me know when the language has been agreed on to include in the confirmations.
 
 Thanks!
