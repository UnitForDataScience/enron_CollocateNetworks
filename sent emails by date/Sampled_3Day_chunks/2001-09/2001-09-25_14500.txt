It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts  otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes. 
 "Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board,
 consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. " 
 
 Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of?
