 Please review the attached draft on the TW posting for trading imbalances.
 The data is not real imbalance data.I wanted to get a draft out since Glen would be out of the office until Thursday.
 Please make any changes to the document & return to me by COB Wednesday, 9/12/01. I will then send a revised final draft out on Thursday and Richard will send the imblance posting document to Toby on Friday afternoon for posting.
 
 Thanks Ramona
