 we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
 I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
 the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
 side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
 into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
 construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
 potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal 
 with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......
 
 
 
 







 
  
 
 Gentlemen,
 
 Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
 permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
 the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
 Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
 working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
 be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
 draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
 expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
 yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
 Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
 Thanks,  Scott
