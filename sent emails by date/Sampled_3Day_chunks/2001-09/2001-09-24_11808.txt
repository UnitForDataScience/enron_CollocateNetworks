 I was just informed by EPMI that there may be a requirement for Retail Ener=
 gy Providers in ERCOT to serve a certain mix of residential rate class/indu=
 strial rate class customers once a certain industrial threshold is crossed =
 (300 Mw of industrial rate class load). =20
 
 EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements.  Therefore, I ca=
 nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement.  However, it i=
 s something we definitely need to look into.  In addition, we (EPMI/EWS) ar=
 e getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they =
 see the pilot and the market structure unfolding.  Specifically, they are n=
 ot pleased with retail energy providers' contracts that contemplate the rig=
 ht to switch between direct access and tariff (and visa-versa).  We will mo=
 nitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their =
 displeasure.
 
 On the residential requirement front, someone needs to address this.  Speci=
 fically, is this true.  If so, what rate classes are considered industrial =
 vs. commercial?  Is there a similar requirement for commercial load?  Is TI=
  considered industrial?  Do we already have industrial customers in our por=
 tfolio?  Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter marke=
 ts?
 
 Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspe=
 ctive as they are focusing on more of the pure, large industrial customers.=
   We will share any information Mike receives with the EES group.=20
