 P.S. Please send "Tarsha" a picture of my dress.  I think I accidentally deleted the picture of my dress, doggonit!  (You know I need to brush p on my e-mail skills.....they laugh at me all the time.)
 
  

 

 
 
             
    Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!
 
    You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress
    but
    the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
    tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)
 
    Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a
    girl
    and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question
    :o)
    Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
    talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to
    walk
    with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with
    the
    biggest smile on her face.
 
    Love ya!
