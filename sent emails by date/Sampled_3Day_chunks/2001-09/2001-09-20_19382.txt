 	PG&E, Socal	
 	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore

Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.
