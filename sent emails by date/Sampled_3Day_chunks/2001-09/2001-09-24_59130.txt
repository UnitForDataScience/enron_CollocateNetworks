More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything.
 
  It is so important that we do this.  If not some of the repercussions may be people resigning -for fear of working downtown/ in a high-rise etc...( Judy & I talked about this). 
 
 I feel this is an opportunity for HR to really make a difference/ contribute/ & have a strong impact, in assuring our employees we are taking active measures to ensure their safety & want to address their feelings.    I'd like to know what your thoughts are on this?  If you'd like to discuss the further, I'd welcome the opportunity.
 
 Thank you for your time.
