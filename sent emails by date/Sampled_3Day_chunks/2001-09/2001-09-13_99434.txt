     I was able to speak with Victoria Westerhaus today about her September (sic) 27, 2001 letter. Victoria said that before she would be prepared to discuss the substance of her letter she would need to speak with Tom and Wayne.  She did; however, mention that neither she nor her client understood why Enron had been so anxious to dissolve the company when her client had several potential buyers very interested in the company. She mentioned that if Enron didn't want to put any more money into AMPS, it should have worked with DP to find a buyer.
     I told Ms. Westerhaus that it was my understanding that a bona fide buyer was not lurking on the horizon and that there was no way that the company could have continued operating. She said that AMPS could have suspended operations instead of dissolving.  She then inquired as to whether the company had, in fact, been dissolved.  In response to that question, I told her that my last meeting about AMPS had been over a week a ago and I had no additional information. I then suggested a conference call between Enron, its counsel and DC and its counsel to try to bridge the parties difference's before the towels wee thrown I n.  She said she'd get with Tom and Wayne and get back to me.
     Please let me know what your schedules look like for the rest of the week.  I will call the Bracewell folks and see how theirs look.  Thanks.
