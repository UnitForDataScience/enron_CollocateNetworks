The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258.
  
     
 Can one of you guys have a look into the ISDA situation with Nordea Bank (formerly Merita). They had an ISDA with ENA but I believe that we are in the process of transfering it to ECTRIC.
 
 A progress report would be appreciated.
 
 Cheers
