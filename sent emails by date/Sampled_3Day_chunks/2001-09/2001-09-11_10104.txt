     be short because there is not a whole lot to discuss.   Rick, FYI, Shelley postponed her meeting
     until 10:00 in the morning so she could listen in on FERC meeting.  Possible means they do
     not have a final ruling as to what direction we are going, but she wanted to give us a "heads
     up" from a system perspective.  Hopefully that helps.  See ya'll in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn

         I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  coming that 
         we need to discuss in the morning. 
 
         1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing 
         2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator 
                 calculation. (as well as fuel) 
         3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts. 
 
         Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that 
         doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn
