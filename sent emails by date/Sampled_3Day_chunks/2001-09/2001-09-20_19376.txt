 I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
  system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:
 
 	PG&E, Socal	
 	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
 	Columbia of Ohio
 
 This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.
