 Danny requested that we set up one day next week for the ETS employees to view the new furniture. A memo would be sent out to all ETS employees inviting them to come by and view the new furniture. 
 
 Please advise the exact location of the room that showcases the furniture and Danny suggested that the assistants being on hand in the room (which I understand is now located on the 4th floor).  Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you, Joan and the assistants each covering one hour.  A hour coverage will not impact anyone's schedule and allow everyone an opportunity to view the furniture.  
 
 I propose Tuesday, September 19th and the following schedule.  The assistants will be notified of the schedule once we confirm the date.
 
 8:00 - 9:00	Joan Lipuscek
 9:00 - 10:00	Audrey Robertson
 10:00 - 11:00	Susan Wadle
 11:00 - 12:00	Linda Wehring	
 12:00 - 1:00	Julie Armstrong
 1:00 - 2:00	Ricki Winters
 2:00 - 3:00	Pilar Ramirez
 3:00 - 4:00	Kathy Campos
 4:00 - 5:00	 Pam Daily
