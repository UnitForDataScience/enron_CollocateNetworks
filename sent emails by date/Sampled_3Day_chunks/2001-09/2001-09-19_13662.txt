 I would like to include the following paragraph in the termination letter to AMPS employees: 
 Please advise. 
 
 NON-COMPETE/CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
 
 When you became an AMPS employee, you signed a confidentiality and non-compete agreement promising to maintain company information in strict confidence.  The provisions of the confidentiality agreement include a non-compete agreement, which is in effect for 24 months after you leave AMPS.  The non-compete and confidentiality provisions are in effect, and we would like to remind you of your responsibility not to share proprietary company information with new employers or competitors of AMPS until the expiration of the 24-month period.  If you have any questions, please refer to the employment agreement which you signed when you became an AMPS employee.
