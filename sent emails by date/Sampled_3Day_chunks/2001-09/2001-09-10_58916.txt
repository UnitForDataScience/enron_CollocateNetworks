 Now that Mark Pickering is completely transferred to Houston from London and is in his office on 27 as the CTO, we all were able to meet on the single sign on/enterprise portal project with Tony Mends.  Tony has been scoping the project and determining the IT needs for the last few weeks.  As you know, Tony now works for Mark.
 
 Mark has some very good ideas for this project and will be following up with you soon on the plans and the progress to date.
 
 Thanks.
