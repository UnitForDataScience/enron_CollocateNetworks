 The pipefitters union is picketing OCI at the Payne Creek jobsite this
 morning. There are 4 pickets at the gate on Ft. Green Road. The gate system
 at the entrance has no designation as to union and non-union so they can
 picket any gate. The picket signs reference low wages according to Greg
 Renz. OCI has an agreement with Forida Maint. union ironworkers to perform
 work. Pipefitters think they should be doing the work. I am going to Payne
 Creek to meet with our supervisors on how to conduct themselves when they
 enter and exit the jobsite. At this point no activity is being directed at
 Nepco. We want to keep it that way.
 Call me on my cell phone if you need me.
