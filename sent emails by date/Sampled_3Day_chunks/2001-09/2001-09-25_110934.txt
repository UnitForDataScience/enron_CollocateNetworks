 FYI - from Robert Poole at Greeley Gas.
 
 Robert:
 Maybe we can get together later this week to see if we can figure out the difference for August.  Let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Theresa
 
 

 
  
 
 Robert, Valerie,
 
 I have revised the fuel percent from .0107 to .0078.  Please call me if
 you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Theresa
 
 (I will start working on correcting all prior months and get an
 adjustment out soon.)
