 Howdy all!
 
 I am just confirming your participation at the Tricks of the Trade (Energy Math) course this Thursday, November 8th. If you have any conflict with attending the course (9:00am-5:00pm, roughly), please let me know ASAP.
 
 I will be distributing some pre-course reading material. While it is not required to complete it prior to the course, it would be very helpful in understanding the class.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know!
 
 Regards,
 Grace
