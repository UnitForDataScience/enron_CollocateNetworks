 Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transa=
 ctions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully o=
 ur situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in=
  the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual=
  things happening in the "Fixed Float" markets in Texas particularily at HS=
 C.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went fr=
 om plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry H=
 ub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.3=
 1 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we ha=
 ve no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some =
 trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more fina=
 ncially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed pri=
 ce physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant=
  in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted f=
 or index consideration.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Tom Martin
