 Deb refers to "bowl tickets".  I assume that she means "playoff tickets", since the bowl tickets won't be allocated until teams are selected for the BCS Bowls (which is after the playoffs in Dallas).

 Dan, Mary Kay would like to have 4 bowl tickets.  In my original request to the University for tickets, her request was in the mix.  Mary Kay called me today to see if she was going to get any tickets.  
 
 My question is: how do you want me to allocate the tickets I have so far?
