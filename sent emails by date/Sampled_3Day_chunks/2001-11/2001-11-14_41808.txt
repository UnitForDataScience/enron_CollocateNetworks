 Dear Lech:
 
 I have attached a version of the proposed Master Netting,  Setoff, and
 Security Agreement between Enron Group and BNP Paribas Group,  subject to
 BNP Paribas' review, along with a redline against Enron's form.   I have
 also faxed the same to you at 212 945-2911.  We  would like to discuss the
 draft with you tomorrow morning with a view to its  execution by tomorrow
 afternoon.  Seth may be reached at 212 572-5317, and  I may be reached at
 212 572-5398.
 
 Yours truly,
 
 
 
 David Rosen
