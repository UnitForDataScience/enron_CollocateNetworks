 Paul,
 
 I am unclear about travel policy at this point:
 
 I need to go to CAISO  market issue forum (aka MIF)  and a 3-RTO conference on market monitoring on Th, Fri in Sacto, SF respectively.  Sue M could go to former but wouldn't be the best for the latter.
 
 Total savings if I do not go (i.e., net of cancellation fees): ~$400
 
 OK to go?
