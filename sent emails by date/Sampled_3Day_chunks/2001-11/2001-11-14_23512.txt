  we have supplied as many as 90 temps on a single
 piece of litigation.  We have considerable experience designing and
 recruiting flexible, cost-efficient teams of knowledgeable legal
 professionals who can handle the routine aspects of a document review,
 while your permanent staff works on more sophisticated matters.  Likewise,
 as your transactional counterparts at Enron begin working on the merger's
 due diligence review, I hope Ad Hoc can offer its experience.  We supplied
 the largest number of temporary lawyers and paralegals to conduct document
 reviews in both the El Paso/Coastal and Exxon/Mobil mergers.  We were also
 involved in the Chevron/Texaco merger and the Waste Management buyout.
 
 Please do not hesitate to call on me at any time if I can be of assistance.
  Again, thank you for confidence in our services.
 
 Best regards,
 
 
 Beth Moore
 President
