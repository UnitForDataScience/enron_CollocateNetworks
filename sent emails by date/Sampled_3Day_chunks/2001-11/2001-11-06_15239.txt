 I faxed the form without a cover sheet.  Let me know if you received it.  
  
 Thanks,

 I have a direct deposit from my paycheck to the credit union for my car payment.  On Friday, I paid off my loan and effective my November 15, 2001 paycheck would like to stop the direct deposit to the credit union.
  
 Thanks,
