 cell number is:  512 3312 but it's enron's phone, so ...
 

 
 as for me, i'm very unsure.  I'm still technically a U.S. employee and my visa expires soon, 
 so I really don't have any idea.  
 
 worst case is i take a well-deserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later ... :)

 Hi Chris,
 
 I don't know where you're at with things ...
 
 i've been impressed how you've handled both the databases and the people involved with databases and
 would be happy to provide you with a solid reference if you ever need one.  please keep this to yourself
 as I don't feel this way about many people here ...
 
 cheers :)
 
 Cooper
