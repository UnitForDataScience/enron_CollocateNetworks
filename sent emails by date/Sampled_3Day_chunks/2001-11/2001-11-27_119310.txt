 Albertson's, Inc., one of the largest food/drug retailers in the U.S., is l=
 ooking for a new General Counsel. Albertson's have been a very good client =
 for the firm over the past 10 years, and if we could place someone there it=
  would probably enhance our relationship.
 
 A description of the position and related matters is attached.
 
 Please give me a call if you have any ideas.
