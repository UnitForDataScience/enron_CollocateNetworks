 I had heard something similar.  We should probably get alicia to
 quantify exactly how much the leakage would be {in dollars} and how the
 mechanics would work.  Please tell alicia that we understand that this
 would be a whalley, mcmahon, causey decision.  We are only trying to
 identify options and quantify breakage and leakage.
 
 Thanks very much for the update keep me posted.
