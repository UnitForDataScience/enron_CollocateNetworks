
 
 hey - thanks for getting back anyway 

    
 
 
 
 Sorry I didn't get a chance to talk with you prior to your interview.  I was out
 of the office on Wednesday and Thursday.  How did it go?  I would say the main
 thing that Randy is looking for is a person that he personally likes and can get
 along with.  He would pass on the best trader in the industry if he thought the
 guy/girl was a jerk.  Randy is a family man.  He likes people that spend time
 with their families (especially with their kids).  Randy is the most honest
 person I have ever met.  I would love to work for him!  Good Luck!
 
 Let me know what you thought!
 
 Ken
