 Dear Mark,
 
 Do you have any news re our acting for a client in acquiring an equity stake
 in Wessex Water? I am being chased by my partners about obtaining clearance
 for them to act.
 
 Please excuse me for in turn chasing you about this; I certainly appreciate
 that you will have more important matters at your hands to deal with these
 days, but for us accepting or refusing mandates from clients or would-be
 clients time is of the essence; I am sure that you will understand this.
 
 With best regards
