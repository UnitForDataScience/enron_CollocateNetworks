 John told me to take off as early as I want tomorrow for the drive.  So I think I shall.  I called my boy at San Joaquin.  
 
   
 
 



   
 I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any.
