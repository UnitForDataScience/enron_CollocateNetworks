 Dear Neil,
  
 Sorry I was traveling on Friday when you called. I appreciate the call and spoke to Mark and he mentioned that you had also chatted as well.
  
 Mark said that you would like to put a confidentiality agreement in place prior to our discussions.
  
 I have attached the one we have used for a starting point. I do not really care which one we use, I thought this might help you out. Please feel free to modify and return to me and I will execute.
  
 I look forward to our meeting.
  
 Thanks,
  
 Cabell
