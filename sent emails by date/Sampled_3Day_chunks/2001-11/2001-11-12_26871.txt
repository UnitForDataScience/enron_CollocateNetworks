I believe that the drive down here is open, may be some slowdown on the way out, not sure.  Whew...I think I covered everything.  See you in a little while.

    Hi,
 
    How are you doing? Still feel like lunch?
 
    I'm sad about Enron's demise. A lot  of people got hurt on this one.
 
    What the hell ....... I feel like lunch  and you probably need to get
    out of there so let me know what's good for  you.
