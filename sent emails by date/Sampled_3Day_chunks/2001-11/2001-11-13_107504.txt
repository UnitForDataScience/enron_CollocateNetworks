 Feel free to send the language.  I'm not sure Peter knows what parts of the agreement need to be modified.  And yes, I think it would be helpful if everyone discussed the changes and methodology ahead of time.

 1.We appointed follwoing persons as our swap trader.
 
      Mr. Michael Hartley

 2.How to calculate Swap Breakage Cost
 
   We understnad the definition of "Reverse Transaction" in the
   Schedule One of the Contract means that banks (and ECTRI)
   calculate breakage cost with theoretical mean interest rate
   excluding any margin,(not with Libid)
