It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither Stan, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended.

      I got Greg Porter's message too, however this doesn't tell me why the
      reserve was initially established in the first quarter - i.e. a
      probable
      liability.  In fact, this document seems more to weigh against your
      need
      to
      establish a liability.  Did I miss something?
