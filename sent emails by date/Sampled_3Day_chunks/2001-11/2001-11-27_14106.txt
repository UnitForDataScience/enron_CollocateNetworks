 Rick or Cole,
 
 PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)
 
 Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?
 
 Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.
