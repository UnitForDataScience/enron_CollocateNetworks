 FirstEnergy has made a filing with regard to the shopping credit for next year.  In that filing they are claiming that they have reached 20% switching and therefore do not need to increase the percentage spread between the price we buy the MSG at and the shopping credit.  I have been working with Scott Reneicke and Nicole Schwartz and am planning to file an intervention on behalf of Enron and contest the calculation of the 20% (which includes affiliate transactions) and the argument to not increase the percentage spread and any other arguments Scott may identify. 
 
 Given circumstances, I am assuming that since this is something I can handle, I should do so as opposed to involving outside counsel.
 
 Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed.
