
 
 I have a 2:00 meeting with a customer.  It should only last about an hour, but I might be able to be there until 3:15 or 3:30.
 
  
     
 I know it has been a while, but I wanted to send you the follow-up on our conversation last week, to make sure I heard everything correctly.
 
 Please let me know if the notes don't correctly reflect your memory of the conversations.  
 
 Thanks a bunch!
