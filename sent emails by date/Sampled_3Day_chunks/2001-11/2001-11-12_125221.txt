 as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.
 PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, but
 he has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. Curtis Martin
 is a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant Shaun
 Alexander is. If he has a good game next week, he may have the starting role or at
 least split carries. 
 The next 2 games will be tough.
