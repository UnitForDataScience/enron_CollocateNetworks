 Please be sure to copy Jim Wood on all correspondence relating to bonds- from a product management standpoint, I think Jim needs to be aware of these issues as failure to maintain bonds will significantly impact our business. .  I still think that  we would want to have a single person responsible for reporting all potential situations that may cause a default /bad pr situation and  notify the EES office of the chairman  in a manner that would allow plenty of opportunity to cure ( i.e., before it is a crisis).  Gloria and Denise, will you take that on?
 
  
 
 



  
 Gloria -
 
 Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  
 
 It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  
 
 Thanks, 
 Rogers
