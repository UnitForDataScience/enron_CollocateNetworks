 Let's get together (just you and I) and figure out how we can make sure our teams are working together.  I am sure that you don't want to worry about this stuff any more than I do.  How about for 15 minutes after the EES Op Comm on Monday?

 Evan,
 
 As you know, the license application function was migrated to the Service Desk in August 2001.  This activity was previously maintained by Beth Gooden.  In any case, our records show that EES is current and compliant.  EES was granted a retail license in August 1999.  To maintain the license, EES must submit an annual "Re-certification" and keep a bond current.  A Re-certification application was submitted on 1/31/01 and the  bond was extended through 6/1/02.
 
 I hope this answers your concerns.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.
 
 
 
 Craig
