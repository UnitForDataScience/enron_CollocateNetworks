 To All -
 
 Attached is the memo documenting our conclusion on the continued deconsolidation of Dabhol if Dabhol Power Company were to issue the Phase II shares that the investors are currently entitled to.  Such an issuance would increase Enron's interest in the company to approximately 65%.  In short, as long as Enron waives its majority consent abilities in a legally binding side letter with GE and Bechtel, we would not have to consolidate Dabhol.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.  Thanks.
