The positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of Man and close the account.  Anything different and all dealings between Man and Enron in energy will be terminated in both OTC and futures.  
 
  
     
 I talked to Man and they agreed to back off.  They will not call for more margin nor will they require us to move positions, as of this minute anyway.  If you hear any differently, please call me.
