 My understanding is that you all will be handling the filings.  It's been so long since I've done UCC filings that I'm not sure I would even remember what to do.
 
 Thanks!

 We have ordered the searches, but not prepared filings.  Are you handling
 the latter, or would you like us to do that, too?
