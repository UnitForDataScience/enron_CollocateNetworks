 Last Friday, the ISO informed you that effective today it would begin
 publishing on OASIS additional information about real time energy purchases.
 Based on concerns and issues raised by CERS and the State of California, the
 ISO is delaying this publication.  We will provide you with additional
 information later this week.
 If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact
