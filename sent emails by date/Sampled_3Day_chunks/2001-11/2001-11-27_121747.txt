 FYI, Kirk did not have good news on the approval for Big Sandy yesterday, but it looks like they have Plan B moving forward.  I will stay in touch with Kirk and keep you posted. 
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
 

    Agreement - Revised 
 
 
 Hi Kim.
 Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
 vote
 yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
 At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
 approved,
 and may opt to resubmit.
 Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
 the
 ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
 Commissioners....major blunder.
 I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
 If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
 agreement,
 etc.
 Best regards,
 Kirk
