 In preparation of NARUC, Jim wants us to handout the Bare Essentials from EPSA and the Well-Designed RTO documents.  He also wants a one-page/4 bullet-point list of message points that EVERYONE should convey while at NARUC.  
  
 Would you mind drafting up those 4 key points?  You can just send me an email and I will format and send everything out to everyone this afternoon.  
  
 Thanks!!
