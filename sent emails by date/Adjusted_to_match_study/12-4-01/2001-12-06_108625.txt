 Hi Elizabeth,
 
 I'm Penny and Sam Britell's friend (Sam's from college) who have
 mentioned (truthfully, insisted) that we should get together for a drink
 next time I'm in NYC.
 I'll be in new york sunday the 7th through the 14th and would love to
 get together for that drink Penny and Sam keep telling me about.
 Fortunately I have a pretty open schedule next week, so if you have any
 time, I'd like to meet you.
 
 I'll be staying at the Penninsula next week, or feel free to call me on
 my cell phone at 713 854 4952.  As well, I'll be checking voicemail in
 the office (713) 853 1761.
 
 I'll be out of the office the next two days, but leave a message if you
 have time.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jeff
