
 
 This is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the DPR.  Ric=
 k Buy, our chief risk officer, asked that we get back to normal as soon as =
 possible.  I am currently working on termination statuses and when deals wi=
 ll be killed etc.  I am also working on a way to get the PCS cleaned up.  C=
 ontinue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more c=
 onfusion than it is worth.
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey

 With all of the events of yesterday, information for the DPR for the above =
 dates is not yet complete.  At the present time, we are planning to issue a=
  final DPR for the 30th of November as well as a preliminary and then final=
  for the 3rd of December.  However, we do not yet have an estimated time fo=
 r these to be issued.
 
 I will keep you up to date when I have additional information.  If you have=
  any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.
