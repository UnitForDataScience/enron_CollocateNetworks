 Mohammad,
 
 What's going on? Hope all you exams went well. Are you coming home for the holidays? If so give me a shout in the office, at home or in Red Deer. Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.

    Hey Chris,
 
    How are you doing?  How are things at Enron.  I was shocked to see the
    stock
    price today.
 
    Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?
 
    Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!
 
    Speak to you soon,
 
    Mohammad
