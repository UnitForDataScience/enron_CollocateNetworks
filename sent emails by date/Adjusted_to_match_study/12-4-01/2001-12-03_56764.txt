 Bob,
 Thanks for taking my call today!  I am pleased to know that you have "a plan"
 and will  be going back to Michigan.  Too bad it had to be under these
 conditions however.  Anyway, good luck to you.
 
 Meanwhile, I am looking for:
 *  IT Talent and those with exp in Risk/Trading.
 Please feel free to pass my info on or send me names and #'s and I will contact
 them directly.
 
 Thanks again Bob and take care!
 Karen
