 Lynn,
 
 Earlier this month, I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated 100% of their firm commodity as overrun.  I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month.  Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldn't be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly.  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting, I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either.  
 
 Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the 10th?
 
 Thanks!
 Vernon
