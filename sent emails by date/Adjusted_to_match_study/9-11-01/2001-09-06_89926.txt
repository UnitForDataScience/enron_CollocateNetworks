
 
 I read the proposal last night, and although it is not perfect, it is a big=
  improvement over what we have today.   Therefore, I (and my team) support =
 Enron's endorsement of the PJM Proposal (with your timeline condition).
 
 Thanks for all your good work.
 
   the=
 ir time line provides for an implementation date of November 2003.  We have=
  talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation =
 process, and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively, but they are unwi=
 lling to change their target date in their proposal.
 
 Because we disagree with the PJM date, we propose to have Enron Power Marke=
 ting, Inc.'s name included on the list of supporters of the proposal, with =
 the following footnote:
 
 =09While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance =
 of PJM's proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein, =
 Enron =09Power Marketing, Inc. dissents from PJM's date of November 2003 fo=
 r implementing the single RTO in the Northeast.  Enron believes that the PJ=
 M proposal =09can and must be implemented by December 2002 and that extensi=
 on of the implementation date past December 2002 is unnecessary and contrar=
 y to the =09Commission's RTO policy established in Order No. 2000.
 
 This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJM's timing in comm=
 ents to the Commission after the Judge submits his report (due on September=
  17).  In those comments we can go into much greater detail about the need =
 for quick implementation.
 
 Please let me know if you have any suggested changes to the footnote or if =
 you disagree with our proposed strategy.  We will address this issue on Thu=
 rsday at mediation (I thought it was going to come up today, which is why I=
  called each of you), so if you have any comments or concerns, please let m=
 e know as soon as possible.=20
 
 Thanks
