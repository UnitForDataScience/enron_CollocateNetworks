 Anthony,  I just spoke with Michelle Blaine's assistant.  Michelle is planning to be in Korea the week of September 17th and would like to conduct the training sometime during that Monday to Thursday.  I will let you know when the date is confirmed.
  
 Also, are you having a regional meeting in Singapore this fall?  I thought it might be a good chance for Michelle to present the FCPA training to the whole group.  The presentation takes one hour.  We are making an effort to provide the training to EBS before year-end, so it would be great to have the Asia region trained as well.  
  
 Please let me know what you think.  Thank you, Michelle
