 Just a short note to reiterate my efforts in  finding a company that would purchase and place the TechnoExplorers  curriculum into schools across the country as a public relations effort and sign  of good corporate citizenry in promoting education in the areas the company has  business operations.
  
 I realize that only a brief overview was discussed  last evening.  I was glad to hear that Steve is considering focusing on  education.  I can put together all the necessary information that  explains the curriculum, the price, professional development training for  educators and other items of interest.  Let me know what you think.   
  
 Thanks,
  
 Joe
