I think we need to have this done today.  Can you let me know what our status is?  Barry is asking me.  Kelli, can we refresh in the morning fairly quickly?  I would love to get this deal done.  Tomarrow, we need to add a little orig!  Please let me know if any of you have any questions.
 
 thanks, 
 
 Kim
 
  

 
  
 
 Tom,
 
 Attached is our term sheet in response to your request for bid.  I have
 also attached sample contract for your review.  We are waiting to hear
 from your credit guy to obtain some financial information.  Please call
 me with any questions or concerns.
