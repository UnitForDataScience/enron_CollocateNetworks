 Jose and Charles
 Given the actions taken by the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board
 last week, we need to take steps to broaden stakeholder support and
 endorsement of these recommendations, especially the one dealing with
 NERC taking on an expanded role for the development of business practice
 standards in addition to reliability standards.
 
 At the FERC panel discussion last Thursday on standardizing business
 practices, it was pretty clear that FERC is not going to make this call,
 but rather leave it up to the industry to decide who assumes this
 responsibility. In this regard, we would welcome the support of Enron
 and EPSA.
 
 Give me a call when you can so we can discuss where Enron is on this,
 and how you might help gain EPSA's support.
 
 Thanks.

 PS - I still remember that at the 1995 FERC Technical Conference on
 OASIS it was Rick Shapiro who first spoke up in response to Betsy
 Moler's question about who should take on the responsibility for
 developing OASIS standards. Maybe Enron wants to be the first one to
 publicly endorse the "New NERC" as the one-stop shop for wholesale
 electric standards.
