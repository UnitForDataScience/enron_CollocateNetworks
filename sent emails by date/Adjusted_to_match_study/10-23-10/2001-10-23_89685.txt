 So far this contract year, we have attended two meetings.  That leaves us
 currently with a backlog of four meetings through this month and a rate of
 use of .67 meetings per month which would make the projected use for the
 year of about eight of the 24 meetings allowed in the contract.  If we
 attend the above two meetings, the backlog would be down to two; the rate
 would be 1.33 per month; and the projected yearend total would still be only
 about 16.
 
 Let me know as soon as possible since meeting #1 is scheduled for tomorrow
 so I would need to make plans.
 Thanks,
 Dan
