 Here is a turn by turn:
 
 Exit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown Houston).  
 
 Go South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).  Take right onto Briarforest Drive.  Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).  We live on Scarborough Fair 

    
 
 Shelley,
 That sounds good. Fred and Marisa may go to the zoo. Do you live off of 290? 
 That is the way we usually come.
