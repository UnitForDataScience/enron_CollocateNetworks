       This would be preferable, but I don't understand what rules could be =
 changed to alter the existing accounting treatment.  Also, Kent's numbers d=
 o not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet =
 that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after th=
 e project was initially developed.  The other thing to keep in mind is that=
  there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.  =
 We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term =
 market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage =
 to capture short term market anomalies).  Are you okay with that?  I am.

 Rod,
 
 We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term=
  project that has negative short term cash flow.
 
 We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen=
 ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi=
 ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This proj=
 ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=
 tandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =
 identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=
 d.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=
 onomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=
 %).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=
  expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=
 ears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=
 ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =
 negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=
 terested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.
 
 What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=
 s in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=
 nron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a gre=
 at project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative e=
 arnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this=
  financial hurdle??????
