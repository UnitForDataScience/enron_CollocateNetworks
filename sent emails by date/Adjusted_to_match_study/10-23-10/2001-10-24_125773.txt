 I want to install some reporting measures on position limits and VAR metrics here in Canada.  Can you give Brian Gillis the necessary access so that he can prepare the reports for me.
 
 If you have any questions give me a call ?

 Debbie, 
 
 I was wanting to get access to the following database for myself and Chelsea Bardal:
 
 O:/erms/controls/rmsdata/~0RMSDBS97a.ldb
 
 We need this access so that we can query and load the VAR information for the Calgary gas desk by trader.  This information will be used to generate a weekly set of performance measures for Rob Milnthorp, the president of ECC, and John Zufferli, the head of ECC trading.
 
 Please let me know if there will be any problems with this.
 
 Brian
