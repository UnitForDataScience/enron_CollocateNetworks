 I didn't save the email verison of the "corrections to published prices" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise:
 
 (1)  You will need two different versions:  one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations	
 
 (2)  Don't capitalize the word "party" in either version
 
 (3)  Use the capitalized term "Interest Rate" for the GTC version
 
 (4)  Use the capitalized term "Applicable Rate" for the ISDA version
 
 When I hear back from Kim T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
