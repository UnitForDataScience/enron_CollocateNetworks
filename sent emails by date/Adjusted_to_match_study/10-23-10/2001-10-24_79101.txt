 Here are two more suggestions.  Mr. Berg represented CBS in a couple of
 defamation claims but generally does plaintiff's work.  Mr. Franklin, I am
 told, also has a very good reputation and recently obtained a five million
 dollar verdict in a case.  Please let me know I can be of further
 assistance.
