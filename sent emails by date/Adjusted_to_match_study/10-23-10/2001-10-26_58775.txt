 [Kean, Steven J.] 
   look forward to seeng you today, although I will be a little late. The funeral for Bob Braden is this morning.  Bob chaired the Greater Houston Chamber, and of significance to me personally, Rice Center.  
  
 We discussed Enron's representation on Central Houston's board.  Alan likes very much the Greg Whalley suggestion; so please go with it.
  
 New adds to the board include:
 Fred Burns, Chairman, Wortham Foundation
 Jim Flores, Chairman & CEO, Plains Resources
 Bob Harvey, Vice Chairman, Reliant
 Bob Onstead
 Al Bledsoe, Managing Partner, PriceWaterhouse Coopers (Al served previously in his Coopers capacity)
  
 Pending (as soon as their companies join) are Jim Hackett, Chairman & CEO, Ocean Energy, and Mike Morgan, President, Kinder-Morgan.
  
 Good luck with Greg; I am available on a moment's notice to meet with him.
  
 Bob
