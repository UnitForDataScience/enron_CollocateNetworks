 Dear Mark and Vince
  
 I know that it has been very trying for us all, but  I do believe that we have got there in the end! I have attached a copy of the  programme that I will send to the printers. Unless I hear from you  by tomorrow my time, I will ask the printer to proceed with the information  that I have.
  
 We can discuss the exact specifics and logistics in  the near future. I will of course be in touch again and will send you both  copies of the brochure when it is printed. 
  
 In the meantime, can I please have the following  information over the next few days (I know my demands are endless, but at least  they are no longer pressing!):
  
 - a professional CV, around 70 to 100 words should  be fine
 - your address
  
 I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  look forward to working with you both on GARP 2002.
  
 Kind regards
  
 Andreas
