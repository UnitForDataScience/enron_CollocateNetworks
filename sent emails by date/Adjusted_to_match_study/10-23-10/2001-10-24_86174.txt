 Mr. Ross,
 
 Attached for your review is a draft of the ISDA Master Agreement between
 Enron North America Corp. and Quadra Energy Trading Ltd.  Please note

 forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also
 sending you the entire package via overnight delivery.
 
 If you have any questions, please call me at the below number or Brent
 Hendry, Senior Counsel, at 713-853-7124.  We look forward to hearing
 your comments.
