At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.  Especially if Steve wants to "pick his brains".
 
  

    
 Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
 basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
 attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
 appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
 progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
 the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
 much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
 model...
 
 Thanks, Kevin
