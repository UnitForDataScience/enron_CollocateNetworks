  I am scheduled to have a reasonably high level
 discussion with Senate Environmental committee. Despite the third priority
 (1st - Economy; 2nd - Security; and 3rd- Environmental), we are still
 thinking that enough noise will be made that we are going towards a 6 MM Ton
 SOX budget by 2007. That is likely bullish unless you discount future values
 heavily, which we do.
