 Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?

 I understand that you will have an Amel at the Ft. Lauderdale boat show
 next month.  Do I need an appointment to see the boat?
