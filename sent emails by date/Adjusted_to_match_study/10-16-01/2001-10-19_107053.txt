       Sara -
 
       As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
       incorporating
       the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of
    ISDA
       (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached
    is
       the
       last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
       suggest
       that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of
    agreement
       since it is the final version.
 
        <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>
 
       Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
       which
       point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
       page)
       via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
       Schedule with your revised Schedule.
 
       Thank you for your patience.
 
       Regards,
       Michelle
