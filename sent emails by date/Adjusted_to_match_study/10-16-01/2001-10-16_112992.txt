 one of the Illinois COmmerce Commissioners, Terry Harvill, is getting married early next month and I would like to send him a small gift.  Am I correct  that I am able to do so without any reporting requirement?  As I recall, the only individual's at the ICC that we have to track are the Chairman and the Exectutive Director?
