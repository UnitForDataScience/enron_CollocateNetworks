 Louis,
 
 We are moving on to the 6th floor Trading area in the new building.  I have two financial traders under John Arnold who would like a spot in the garage (not reserved) and have not been offered that choice as of yet.  One is currently in the Allen Center and one is in the Clay Garage.  Please help me out on this if at all possible.  I would really like to make their day.
 
 Their names are Mike Maggi and Andy Zipper.
 
 
 Many thanks, 
 
 Ina Rangel
