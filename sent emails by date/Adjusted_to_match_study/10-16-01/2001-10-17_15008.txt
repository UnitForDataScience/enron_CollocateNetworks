 The customers asked that we send them our 7/17 offer in writing.  Here is a draft for your review.  The .xls spreadsheet shows the calculation of the 6/1/01 adjustment amount for R&T and the credit to the SLA.
 
 We'd like to send this out to the customers this afternoon.  Please give me any comments you have by 3:00 today.  sjk
