   AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re=
 al-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time ener=
 gy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio=
 .
 
 Can we use their own testimony against them?
 
  
    colay, Christi L.; Maurer, Luiz; Keene, Patrick; Twiggs, Thane; Ryall, Jean=
 ; Hamb, Edward
  
 Attached is the testimony that I filed today asking thh PUC of Texas to ope=
 n the retail markets in the SPP territory.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
