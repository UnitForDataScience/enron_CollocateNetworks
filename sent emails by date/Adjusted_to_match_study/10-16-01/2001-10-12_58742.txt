 The summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).  Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next.  Otherwise, the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe.

 					Mark - I left a voice mail on your cell.
 
 					The Wind Production Tax Credit expires on December 31, 2001.   The PTC will be extended.   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC, the revenue number is reasonable, and renewables are a key component of the energy debate.
 
 					The question is when and how.  Two likely scenarios are:
 
 					1)  As part of the Energy Bill.  The House Ways and Means Committee will mark-up the tax portions of the energy bill in mid-July.  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill.  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a mark-up.  While the energy bill will be debated during July, final action will likely not occur until after the August recess.   In this scenario, look to September at the earliest.
 
 					2)  There are 10 provisions, including the PTC,  in the IRC that expire by December 31, 2001.   Historically, Congress approves an "extenders" package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning.   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn, they are set to adjourn in early October.  In this scenario, the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest.
 
 					Mark, this is Congress, so anything can change.
