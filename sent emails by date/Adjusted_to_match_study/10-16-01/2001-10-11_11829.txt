 Bruce Garner has asked me to bring you into a trade we're looking at with Balli-Klockner (BK). Ken Curry was asked to evaluate a related proposal a week back but is now on holiday and Rebecca Phillips was not brought up to speed. This latest proposal would be a European trade and the client is under time constraints and keen to move fast.
 
 The transaction is as follows:
 
 Enron has the right to sell to BK physical Hot Rolled Coil steel at Index (CRU HRC) + 7.5% 
 
 Start:  Jan2002
 
 End:    Dec2016
 
 Tonnage:        500 000 Metric Tonnes per annum (total tonnage: 7.5 million MT)
 
 Enron pays a premium of 30 million USD upon contracting.
 
 The CRU Index is Enron's benchmark steel index and physical steel trades at Index flat. There is thus 7.5% intrinsic value in the puts which translates to approx. $75 million USD in present value terms ($45million net of premium).
 
 Our counterparty would be the parent of the soon to be combined Balli Klockner PLC and the various Balli service centres soon to be merged (BK Holdings Ltd UK). BK are not offering us additional credit relief, ie. bank guarantees, LC's, insurance bonds, etc. Your help in establishing our appetite and an appropriate credit charge for this transaction would be much appreciated.
 
 Many thanks
