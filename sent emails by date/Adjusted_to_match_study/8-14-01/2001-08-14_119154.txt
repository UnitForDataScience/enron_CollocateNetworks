 Hi both of you
 
 In regard to the online due diligence that was done for the European EBS launch back in March/April - would you have any copies of documents for the following countries:
 
 Japan
 Australia
 Hong Kong
 Singapore
 
 If so, could you please forward them to me?  Choon-Boon Heng out in Houston is interested in reading them for his new product type launch for Asian physical bandwidth coming up in the beginning of September.
 
 If not, could you please advise whether there were any additional issues with online trading on top of off-line trading in regard to the above.  There will be point to points within these countries.
 
 Thank you very much and have a lovely weekend!
 Marie
