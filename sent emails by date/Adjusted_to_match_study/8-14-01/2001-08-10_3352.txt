  ie our
    biggest
 
    concievable draw would be in the order of 2.2 tcf-leaves us around 1 tcf
    end
 
    march, hard to get too excited about that. sprds? not much of clue-i
    tend to
 
    think inverses cont to errode like feb/apr-but maybe not until mkt gives
    up
 
    on winter. prepensity for us to stay contango maybe accelerates.that
    this
 
    year.
 
       you think we get to shut in levels? since so much prod growth appears
    to
 
    be from independents does that raise the avg shut in value from say 1.60
    to
 
    $2.00 or higher??
 
        anyway-be cool,hope all is well. enjoy the weekend. are you going to
    be
 
    in NYC anytime soon?
