 Can you please find the different prices (coach vs. business) so I can have a record?
 
 Thanks,

 Below are the flight reservations I am doing in advance for Christmas, to prevent last minute problems. I am arranging to flight coach. I think you would not mind my eventually exchanging 2 business tickets for 4 coach (as far as I know, the coach rate is less than half the business).
 I would leave Houston Friday, Dec 21 at 7:02pm and return Thursday, Jan 03 at 8:44am
 Please let me know if this is OK with you.
 Thanks
 Guillermo
