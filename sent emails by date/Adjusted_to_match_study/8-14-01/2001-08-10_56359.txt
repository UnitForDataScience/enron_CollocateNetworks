
 
 Sheridan,
 
 I am going out to lunch with Rick Buy today and will
 mention the valuation seminar. 
 I shall ask Rick how many employees from his
 group he would send to this program.
 
 I have no suggestions regarding the program,
 except that the last year selection of topics
 was very interesting. You can include e-bus
 and on-line trading as the topics for 2002.
 
 
 My address is:
 
 1400 Smith
 Houston, TX 77002 - 7361
 Room EB1962
