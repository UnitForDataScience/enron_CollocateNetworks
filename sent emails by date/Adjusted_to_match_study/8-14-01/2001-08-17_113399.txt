   the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.
 
 g.   Siting
 
 On siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.
 
 h.   Reliability
 
 On a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.
 
 i.   Negawatts
 
 I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the "California bill" earlier this summer.
 
 Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.
