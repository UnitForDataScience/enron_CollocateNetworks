 IMServe is interested in participating in the ComEd case as part of our ARES coalition but wants to assess whether there is a business opportunity for them.  Are we bound in contract to CSC or would we be open to a presentation by them for them to handle our  business?  Please advise or let me know who I should talk with that makes those decisions.
 Thanks,
 Janine
