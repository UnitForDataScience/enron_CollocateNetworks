 t let's make sure that we have outlined our "needs" and "wants" and "no way=
 s" before going in.  Also, who would cover and can we do this in Houston (g=
 uessing most of the parties in town)?

 Attached is a draft motion of Salt River Project to establish a date certai=
 n
 for convening a settlement conference under Rule 602, in accordance with th=
 e
 settlement package distributed on July 30. Paragraph 8 of the motion will
 list all parties that are in support of this procedural motion.  A company'=
 s
 support for the motion IN NO WAY reflects any agreement to support any
 setttlement proposal.  It merely indicates a desire to initiate a parallel
 settlement path without interfering with or delaying FERC's processing of
 the ongoing proceedings. Please reply to all by COB Tuesday in advising
 whether your company would like to be listed.  We intend to file on
 Wednesday early afternoon.  Thank you.
