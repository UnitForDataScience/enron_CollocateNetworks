 Hi
 
 I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.
 
 At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.
 
 We were wondering about a couple of things:
 
 Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
 Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?
 
 Thanks for your help
