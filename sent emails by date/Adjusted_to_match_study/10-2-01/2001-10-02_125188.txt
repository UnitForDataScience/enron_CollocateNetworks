 1) you WILL be attending"Art"
 2) you may remove and re-don pants at your leisure during the show, but you
 WILL arrive and leave suitably dressed.
 3) AoE should be ON tonight, or some acceptable replacement strategy/shooter
 game playable by 4+ people.

   All, 
 This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a 
 night at the Alley, 
 to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
 (exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
 Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
 perfect thing! 
 Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
 meets your 
 faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
 Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
 Starbucks, but requires pants! 
 Invite your friends and foes alike! 
 Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
 Get back at me, playas, 
 they're going fast. 
 Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
 Whoooooo! 
 Jason
