
 
 FYI
 
   both the process of contemplat=
 ion as well as the future itself.  I do intend to find some arguably produc=
 tive and/or fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time, and finding out w=
 hat those may be should be half the fun.  Perhaps the biggest concern is ho=
 w long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the hou=
 se every weekday morning, but she's at the church a lot of the time anyway.=
   I'm sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will a=
 ffect their tranquility and privacy, and that remains to be seen, although =
 I doubt that I'll be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyw=
 ay.=20
         One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better j=
 ob of keeping up with friends.  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that =
 endeavor, but I will also be available in person for lunches, happy hours, =
 tee times, dinners, movies, and other consultations. I already know where t=

 com; 3507 Plumb, Houston, TX 77005; phone 713-665-5315; and fax 713-665-741=
 0.  As time goes on, I may self-indulgently send e-mail updates; if you con=
 sider them "spam," you know where the "Delete" button is.=20
         Linda and I will be out of town on a trip to New England next week,=
  but when we return I will commence a substantially different way of life. =
  I am eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold.  Like most people,=
  I'm anxious to spend more time with my family (they may be a little anxiou=
 s about that, too).  Myriads of exciting new opportunities and challenges u=
 ndoubtedly await, and I'm looking forward to discovering and pursuing many =
 of them.  The list of things I want or need to do is already quite long, an=
 d will likely grow even faster than I can check things off the list.=20
         As for the very immediate future, I'm going to click on "Send," pic=
 k up my briefcase, and head for the elevator.  We have to get ready to go t=
 o Brian's volleyball tournament in Dallas tomorrow.  So long for now, best =
 wishes, and see ya around.
