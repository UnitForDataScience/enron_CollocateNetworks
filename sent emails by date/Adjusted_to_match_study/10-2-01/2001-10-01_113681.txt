 Thanks again,
 
 -Joe

       Dear Joe,
 
       Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about
    3:00
       p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could
       come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my
    son's
       soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for
    you???
