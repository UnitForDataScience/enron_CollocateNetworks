 Casey,
 I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.
 
 I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.
 
 Your final showed $341,000.
 
 Please give me a call.
