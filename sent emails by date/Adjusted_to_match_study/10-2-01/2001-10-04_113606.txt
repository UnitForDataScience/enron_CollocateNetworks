 Message from Jack King, Chair of the Desert STAR Board of Directors:
 I have been informed by the Transmission Owners that they plan to move
 forward with a filing at FERC in the near future to create a for-profit
 Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and that they do not intend to fund
 any future activities of Desert STAR.  Without funding, the Desert STAR
 Board of Directors feels that it has no choice but to start dissolving
 Desert STAR.
 On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank all of the
 stakeholders for their support of Desert STAR and to wish all stakeholders
 the best of fortune in this evolving environment.
