 We are offered at $2.69 for San Juan gas for August.  The adders for scheduling are the same.  Let me know if there is anything else that you need.  Sorry for the delay but I think we've gotten everything straightened out here.  The trader just had a computer issue.  '
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
  

    
 
 Janette,
 
 Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in
 order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the
 guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable
 to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP
 BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.
 
 Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day
 but have moved back up.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
