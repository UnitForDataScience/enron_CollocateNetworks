I guess you can consider this one closed, except that I would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to Kim and me for review and placement in the file.  Thanks!

 Kim/Michelle -
 
 Chuck will be contacting you on the non-solicitation language.  I asked him to coordinate directly as I am in meetings all day and would just hold up the process. 
 
 Chuck started out y-day indicating that he just could not live with the language and then this am I told him that If he couldn't live with the language I would ask whether or not we could offer them the 1/2 Restructuring package.  when he realized that he may be stuck with a package that would yield 1/2 the $$$ he changed his tune.  Now he is saying that all he needs is assurance that our intent is not to keep him out of work at a competitor.  In fact, he said he REALLY wanted to sign this today.  
 
 I think all we need to do is explain our intent with the non-solicitation language.  I do not feel we should change the language for him but would like to see us come to an agreement.
 
 Thanks,
 Rogers
