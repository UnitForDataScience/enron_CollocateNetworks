 The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis=20
 administration have saddled California with billions of dollars of "strande=
 d=20
 costs" that will burden our economy and state budget for years to come.=20
 Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio=
 n=20
 long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20
 energy market. Here's the real story:=20
 Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state=
 =20
 generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.=
 =20
 This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November=
 ,=20
 it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati=
 on=20
 gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ=
 y=20
 purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20
 billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state=
 =20
 budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass=
 =20
 the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to=
 =20
 issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20
 In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout=
 s=20
 rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia=
 te=20
 long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20
 long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at=
 =20
 the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The=
 =20
 cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug=
 e=20
 glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20
 construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20
 resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate=
 =20
 the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of=
 =20
 three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in=
 =20
 the long-term energy contracts.=20
 To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse=
 s.=20
 Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20
 redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20
 bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract=
 s=20
 that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly=
 =20
 objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of=
 =20
 environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the=
 =20
 generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b=
 y=20
 the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over=
 =20
 the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20
 Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our=
 =20
 energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer=
 =20
 has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20
 recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20
 Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20
 cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20
 The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California=
 =20
 still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity=
 =20
 costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20
 businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th=
 e=20
 state's economic growth.=20
 There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is t=
 o=20
 have full public review of major energy decisions. Equally important, the=
 =20
 Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making=20
 authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.
 
 
 
 
 
 Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
 Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20

 Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means=
 =20
 that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost=
 =20
 of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20
 Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20
 equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20
 contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile=
 =20
 and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe=
 r,=20
 and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric=
 e=20
 it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio=
 n=20
 to $35 million.=20
 The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,=
 =20
 the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20
 electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing=
 =20
 business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned=
 =20
 utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since=
 =20
 then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much =
 as=20
 20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it=
 =20
 was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20
 Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month=
 =20
 of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you=
 'd=20
 expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"=
 =20
 said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20
 Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on=
 =20
 average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for=
 =20
 some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an=
 d=20
 $148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas=
 ed=20
 under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20
 excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27=
 =20
 per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t=
 he=20
 DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20
 This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat=
 e=20
 was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at=
 =20
 times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly=
 =20
 power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20
 obligations.=20
 Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow=
 n=20
 substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 =
 by=20
 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20
 factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International=
 ,=20
 sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting=
 =20
 energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20
 Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average=
 =20
 cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i=
 s=20
 more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices=
 =20
 averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen=
 cy=20
 $1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the=
 =20
 huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is=
 =20
 pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i=
 ts=20
 coffers.=20
 The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed =
 by=20
 federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.=
 =20
 So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3=
 6=20
 billion under short-term arrangements and $5.54 billion on spot-market=20
 purchases, according to the DWR documents.=20
 But the state's "long" position in July, in which it had too much power, ha=
 s=20
 at times given power-trading companies an arbitrage opportunity. Last=20
 Wednesday, for example, the state sold electricity for as little as $2 per=
 =20
 megawatt hour on the same day that it was paying $22 to $75 on the spot=20
 market, presumably because its advance purchases did not exactly match the=
 =20
 actual shape of demand.=20
 John Stout, senior vice president for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., a=
 =20
 big energy supplier to California , said a trader can double or triple his=
 =20
 company's profit by substituting cheap market power from the water-resource=
 s=20
 agency for power the company otherwise would generate. It is also free to=
 =20
 resell the natural gas it might have used to fuel its plants. "That's what=
 =20
 the trader is there to do and not leave money on the table," said Mr. Stout=
