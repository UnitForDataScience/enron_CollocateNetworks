 Hello Suzanne,
 
 I received a message stating that Mark Taylor would prefer that the NatWest
 ISDA Master Agreement survive.  We agree.  Enclosed please find a revised
 Assignment Agreement for your perusal.  Please note that the novation is
 scheduled for October 26, 2001, therefore time is of the essence.  Should
 you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  My contact details are
 listed below.
 
 Regards,
 
 Diane
