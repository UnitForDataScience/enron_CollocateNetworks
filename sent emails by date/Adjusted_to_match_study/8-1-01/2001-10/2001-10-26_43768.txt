 	Mr. Colin Wilkes from GE in Schenectady has agreed to speak on the topics below.  Thanks for your help.  We need to get together and have lunch to discuss the Sun Devil project on TW.  Talk with you soon.

 	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
 subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
 will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
 www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html
 
 One of our proposed speaking topics is "Changing Gas Quality Specs"  and
 the impact to today's turbines which are supposedly much more sensitive
 to gas specs than older generation units.  Another potential topic is
 "Pressure Reliability" dealing with the impact to gen units with varying
 fuel pressures.
 
 I'm looking for an expert at GE Power Systems who would be willing to
 give a 15-30 minute presentation on either of these topics on the
 afternoon of March 20, 2002.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other
 presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  
 
 If you have someone who may be interested, please let me know and I can
 send them a formal invitation or just have them call me direct.  Thanks
 for the help!
