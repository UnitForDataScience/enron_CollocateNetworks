 A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
 A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
 After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
 This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
 The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.
 
 Hope this helps.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
