 what is the difference between this spark spread function call and the one =
 being used in the spreadsheets we use ?

 Slava:
 Here are the files related to the models I mentioned in our phone coversati=
 on.
 
 FwdFwd Vols:
 
 Here is a spreadshet implementing a technique for calculating fwd fwd volat=
 ilities for seasonal vol curves. The approach avoids the issue of geting ne=
 gative fwd fwd variances when using the traditional approach. It makes nece=
 ssary, however, to develop a specific fwd fwd vol curve for each contract m=
 onth.=20
 
 Here is how it works:
 =091) Create a variance curve: Var =3D vol*vol*(Ti-t)
 =092) Fit a desoasonalized curve with functional form: y =3D a*(tb)?=093) c=
 alculate fwd-fwd variances for the desoasonal curve:?=094) Calculate fwd-fw=
 d vols for each month by multiplying the ?=09    fwd-fwd variance curve by =
 a factor equal to:?=09=09=09SQRT(Var(Contract Month)/Var(fit))??? << File: =
 FwdFwd.xls >> ?I implemented a C code for calculating that. This, with the =
 omicron vols may be used to model the gas curve evolution in a HJM framewor=
