 Pat,
 
 Thanks for letting me know about the Adaytum invoice issue that Joe Darensbourg contacted you about.  I have not been involved in any of the invoicing with Adaytum, Tracy Geaccone is handling that for ETS. 
 
 Would you please e-mail Tracy and let her know the particulars of this issue.   I assume Joe has taken care of it, but I would like to keep her in the loop on any cost or invoice issues.
 
 Thanks.
