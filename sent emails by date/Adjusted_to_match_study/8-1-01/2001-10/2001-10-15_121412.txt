 Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
  

 
  
 
 Kent,
 
 Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
 natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
 transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
 year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
 we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
 ready to transact.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
 by to help, too.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim Ward
