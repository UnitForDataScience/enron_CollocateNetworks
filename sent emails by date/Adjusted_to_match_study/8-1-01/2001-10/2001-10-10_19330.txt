You have that proposal?  And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.  I can check on that.
  
 Best,

 Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an 
 application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 
 
 In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the 
 northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
 January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order 
 (Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II" 
 application.
