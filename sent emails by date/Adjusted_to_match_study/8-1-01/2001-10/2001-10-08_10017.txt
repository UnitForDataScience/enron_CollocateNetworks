 	before we turn anything off. How about 1:00 Tuesday, October 9th in my office or Sheila's
 	office?  Thanks. Lynn

 All,
 some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity reports in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  Since the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones, the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of reports that are used for same information.
 
 At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old reports as part of changes implemented on 10/13.
 
 Thanks
