 Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
 basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
 attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
 appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
 progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
 the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
 much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
 model...
 
 Thanks, Kevin
