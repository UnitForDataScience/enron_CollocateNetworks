 Also, what did AGA do with its Storage Figure Report?  I heard that they cancelled the publication.

  The referenced form is a new form o be completed for the month of August, 2001.  It was due on 9/30/01, and I received it this week.
 Donna - Is this the form that you were working on that we did the special request from CSC, ie, the FERC filing?  Thought maybe it was the same thing since it is new, effective 8/01 as you said the FERC request was.  Please let me know.
 Cathy - This was originally addressed to George Phillips, and I believe he was in your group previously.  Any insight? 
 I only have a hard copy, so I can't forward it to you.
