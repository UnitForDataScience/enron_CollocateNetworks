 Brian,
 
 Please see the attached Change Order No. 1 on which I have redlined my comments.
 
 Check to make sure that the signature block for E-Next/ENA conforms with the signature block in the Purchase Agreement.
 
 Also, please verify with Lisa, Kathleen and Billy that they are OK with the form Change Order. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Scott
