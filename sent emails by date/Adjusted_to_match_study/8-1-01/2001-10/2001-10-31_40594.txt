 I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as =
 Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the cu=
 rrent organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer =
 in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently ar=
 e similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Cor=
 p on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talen=
 ts and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some othe=
 rs.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial=
  units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for =
 themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willin=
 g to carve out some priorities.
