 If the file is a small blue box with deal numbers and prices, I can open it. 
 
 Thanks,

     Here is what Charlie Sanchez sent.  He said we purchased 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29 and a total of 240,000 fixed price NYMEX.  He said it looks like you missed the purchase from 12/28/00 and it seems like you only show 100,000 of the 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29.  Ask Kim what she thinks.
