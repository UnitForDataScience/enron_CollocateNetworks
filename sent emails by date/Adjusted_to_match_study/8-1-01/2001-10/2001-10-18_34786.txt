 AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th
 AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.
 
 Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry about it.
 
 Thanks 
 
  

    
 
 Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
 on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
 would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my
 notes.
 
 Thanks
