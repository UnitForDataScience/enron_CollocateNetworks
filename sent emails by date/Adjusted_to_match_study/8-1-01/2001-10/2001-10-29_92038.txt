 Technical Bulletin 81 - Submitting Virtual Bids in the Day-Ahead
 Market    - is being distributed for Market Participant
 comment.  The Technical Bulletin will be posted to the NYISO
 web site following the comment period.
 
 The purpose of our Technical Bulletins is to facilitate participation
 in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts,
 techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they
 can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.
 
 Please forward comments on this Technical Bulletin, via email,
 by 5PM on Friday, November 2, 2001 to:
 
 Peter Lemme
