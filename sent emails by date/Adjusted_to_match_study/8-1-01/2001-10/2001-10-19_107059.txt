 I may have mentioned this a long time ago and then forgotten about it but I'd like to coordinate with the group that administers eRequest so that this becomes a requestable app on eRequest. Someone would then be able to make a request for access to the db and you'd have to approve it. The eRequest group would then be responsible for giving them access. That way, you don't have to wait on me.

 Rhonda,
 
 I just checked Harlan's computer and he still does not have the icon for our much beloved database.   Can you advise me on what to do and please don't call the database police on me.  Also, Travis McCullough should also get access as well as Steve Hall in Portland.
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Genia
