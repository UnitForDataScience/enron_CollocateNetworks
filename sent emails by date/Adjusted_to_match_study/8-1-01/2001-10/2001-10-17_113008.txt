 NERC Roster
 
 The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
 expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
 industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
 21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
 functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
 its standing committees.
 
 Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
 the Board.
 
 A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
 site.
