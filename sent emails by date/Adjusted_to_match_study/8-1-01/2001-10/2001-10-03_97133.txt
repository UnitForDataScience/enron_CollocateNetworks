 Attached are revised versions of the Second Amendment to the Master Netting
 
 Agreement (with a blacklined copy) reflecting my comments on Lisa's draft
 
 and Robert's comments, a revised version of the Security Agreement (with a
 
 blacklined copy) incorporating Lisa's comments, and a Ratification of
 
 Guaranty for each of the guaranties.
 
 Please note that David Burns has not had an opportunity to review these
 
 revised documents and may have some comments tomorrow morning.
