 thanks a ton jennifer. but thanks to the portland fiasco relations between me and Amr are not the same again. In short I have lost faith in people. He did mention about this fundamentals group, but did not mention that he was heading it or that he is looking to hire people.
 
 lets hope for the best and see how things evolve. however the best part of the houston trip, apart from the value additions professionally, was that I got to meet good people like Jim, Rick and you. I am pretty contended with that. This however does in no way mean that i would not try for any opening in houston. i am doubly or should i say triply motivated now (post the arrival of the kid) to seek all options that would lead me to the US.
 
 How are things your end. has the house been sold off or are you still struggling to find a buyer? where would you be this christmas - portland i presume appears the most likely place. how is steve, convey my regards to him.
 
 regards
 ban
 
 
 
 


  
  
 You probably already talked to Amr about this, but it was just announced that he is going to be informally putting together a "fundamentals" group within this department.  It seems to me that this is something you would be interested in.  If you haven't already, I would ask him about it.  Also, he is probably a lot better able than I to give you a good idea about where this group is headed and whether he foresees any openings.
