 Kevin,
 
 My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
 he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
  real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20
 
 I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
 product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
 eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
 m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
 ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
 our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
 uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
 I would be short at $28.
 
 The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
 on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
 ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
 at needed to be prescheduled.
 
 As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
 age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
  review).
 
 "This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
 ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
 of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
 ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
 t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."
 
 Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.
 
  it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
 d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
 L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
 r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
 thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
 ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
 ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
 tion.
 
 Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
 ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
 ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
 t language and EOL mechanics.
 
 Thanks.
