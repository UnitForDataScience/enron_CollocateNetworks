 In response to the recent order from President Bush to freeze any assets held in the name of a published list of groups and individuals suspected of terrorist activity, we conducted a search of the GCP database to ensure we did not have any established relationship with anyone on the list.
 
 We found no such relationships with Enron Europe.  However, we thought we had better inform you that we did discover one record, created for Houston EES, with the following name which did appear on the list:
 
 Mustafa M Ahmad GCP ID 130061.
 
 The ID has been suspended by my GCP team here.  Please let me know if you need any further information.  
 
 Kind regards
 
 Anna
