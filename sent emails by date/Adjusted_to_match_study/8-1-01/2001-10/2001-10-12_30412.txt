 Hi Tracy, 
 
 Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
 morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
 previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
 expenditures. 
 
 For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
 for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
 not condusive to SAP type sorting. 
 
 Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
 The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
 November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
 to the final one. 
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
