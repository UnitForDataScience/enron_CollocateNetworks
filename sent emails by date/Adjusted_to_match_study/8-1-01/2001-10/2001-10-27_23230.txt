 Jim,
 
 We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
 meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their calendars.
 
 Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose
 and made any other modifications you wish), or would you rather I
 contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more
 information?
 
 Thanks.
 
 David
 
 
  
 
 After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
 the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
 notify you of the new date.
 
 Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
 have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
 I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.
