They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about the CD player 

    
 
 Of course, that will be OK.  I'll need to find another helper so we have 3.  Will Kim be there?  If not, maybe I can enlist my husband. 
 Will you be at 8:30 service?  If so I can get the CD from you then.  I really need to buy a CD player - maybe I can do that by Saturday so we don't have to pass yours back and forth.  I'll let you know if I'm successful. 
 Thanks for the attendance numbers - I'll call Jackie tomorrow.
