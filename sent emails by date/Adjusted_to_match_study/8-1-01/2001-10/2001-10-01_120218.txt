 I let them know that we will be there unless we are delayed.

 Paul,
 
 As we discussed in our recent phone call, my recommendation is to attend
 the course, because the level of detail will be far greater than we in the
 Customer Relations department can provide. I have tentatively reserved a
 conference room at the Power Control Center for 4 pm, on Oct. 15th if you
 are able to make it. I've also invited  F. Francis to join us. Please let
 me know if you will be able to meet at 4pm, or some later time.
 
 Also, I spoke with Juan Padron this morning and firmed-up our plans for
 Frank and I to visit you in Houston on the 10/22. We will plan to be in
 Houston for whatever hours are convenient to meet with you and Juan on that
 day. I suggested to Juan that if there are any issues that you would like
 us to address during the visit, just let us know ahead of time so that we
 may prepare.
 
 Thanks,
 Dave

 Dave,
 
 I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I
 was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and
 Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that
 you can give us the same information that the course would while you are
 here?  Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
