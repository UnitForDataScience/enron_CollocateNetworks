 montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
 presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
 written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical "Evangeline".
 They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
 would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
 up!  Then send this on.  I did.
