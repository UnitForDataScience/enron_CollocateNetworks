Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday 

 
  
 
 My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure
 what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft.
 Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these
 that looked interesting:
 
 
 Bistro Mezzaluna
 Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
 Left Bank
 Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
 Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)
 
 Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the
 airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last
 two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and
 see what you think.
