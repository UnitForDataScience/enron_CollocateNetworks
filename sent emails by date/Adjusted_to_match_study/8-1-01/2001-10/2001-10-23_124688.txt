 All,
 Please be advised that the SI Server Certificates on the primary SI site in
 Folsom will expire in about a month.  We are planning to install ISO
 issued/trusted Certificates on the Folsom SI servers as we have already done
 on the Alhambra server several months ago. We presently use Verasign as the
 Third Party Trust.  We would like input from you as to any known issues with
 authentication at the Alhambra SI site and any impact you may have seen
 after our implementation there.  Please provide feedback to me via e-mail
 prior to this Wednesday's TSWG meeting and I will consolidate concerns so
 that we may discuss these in that forum.
 Best Regards,
