 TEA is looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, June-Sep'02, into MEAG.  Also looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, Cal'02, into MEAG.  I told them we may be more willing to offer into GTC.  His response was he would need to know which facility or interface would be the source (I suspect this is so he can reserve ahead to use his network transmission).  
 
 Any interest?
