 PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal
 Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.
 SACRAMENTO is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.
 
 "I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."
