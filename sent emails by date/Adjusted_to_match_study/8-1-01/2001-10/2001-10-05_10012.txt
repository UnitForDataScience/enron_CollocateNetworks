 Looks like we lost the meter pulsar signal or module on the 25th - No measurement since.    Passed to Jim Westbrook - Owatonna Team.   Will need to get Sep. volumes to GMS for accounting close.
 
 I passed to Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy.
 
 :Jim - please let the NNG Measurement Desk know when you get the meter back up.
 
 GMS - Bobbie - please pass to the GMS accounting rep for this station.
