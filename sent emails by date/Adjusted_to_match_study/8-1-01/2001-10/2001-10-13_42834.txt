 Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.
 
 PRODUCTION
 
 This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling. 
 
 Existing production
 
 Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin  this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.
 
 Provided things go according to plan, we should have "rough" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard.
