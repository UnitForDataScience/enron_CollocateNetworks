 Fran, 
 
 In reviewing the Management Summary, we had the following questions: 
 
 1.  We noted that $14.8 million P&L related to Middle Market Originations 
 (Foster).  Does this relate to a specific deal or several small deals? 
 2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading (Belden)- 
 legal and bank fees.  What do these expenses relate to? 
 
 If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  As earnings release 
 is quickly approaching, we would appreciate your prompt assistance. 
 
 Thank you, 
 Jennifer
