The alert day imbalances are treated differently - the alert day imbalances are settled at 200% of the high (weekly) index for overburns on an overage alert day and 50% of the low ( weekly) index for underburns on an underage alert day.
 
  

    
 Rachel,
 
 To recap one question/answer:
 
 In an OFO situation, the customer faces a $10/Dth penalty.  What happens to
 the volume imbalance?  Is it immediately cashed-out as with the Overage
 Alert Day, or does it hit the monthly imbalance for cash-out/book-out?
 
 Do I have it right by saying that in an Alert Day situation, the volume is
 immediately cashed-out daily?
 
 When you get a minute, please advise.  Thank you!
 
 David
