   all can make it except (maybe) Green.
 
 Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
 folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?
 
 Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
 have, amid all the other matters on your plate.
 
 David
