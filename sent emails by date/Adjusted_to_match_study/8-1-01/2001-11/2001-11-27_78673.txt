 I wanted to follow up on a couple minor items.
 
 Have you booked the $102,010 discount associated with the Northwestern deal as income?
 
 On the Delta Power LM 6000 deal, I believe the legal invoices should be split according to the income allocation. I think the split was $4 million to Calger, and $2 million to me. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben
