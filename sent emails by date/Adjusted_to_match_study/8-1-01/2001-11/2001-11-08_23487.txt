    I did not get the sense he was too
 busy to do so).  He has worked on de facto 'takings' in Iraq cases, and has
 had a number of cases that have involved questions of mitigation.  In
 addition, he seemed familiar with the option to sue clause in many
 policies.  He has done some work in the distant past with the GOI on
 letters of credit and shipping matters.  He was the only one that mentioned
 that we might spend some time in the near term thinking about what events
 we might 'cause' to occur that could help our claims.
 
 Richard Jacobs is a fairly young barrister, but had read up on our case and
 did some preliminary research on case law on political risk insurance
 issues (which, incidentally, all four barristers agree hardly exists).  He
 did some PRI work in Russia in the early 1990s, and represented brokers in
 a lender PRI claim regarding a South Seas power station. He stated that
 many insurance coverage issues (no matter the type of policy) are basically
 the same questions with a different twist.    Interestingly, he has just
 given some advice to a European investor about a dispute in India on a
 power plant (contractual matter, not insurance related).  He definitely
 grasped that a detailed review of the facts would be the driver for an
 expropriation claim.  He has travelled to India.  He has capacity to work
 with us in the next 4-8 weeks and beyond.  He would be a solid guy to use
 as a back-up.
 
 Stewart Boyd, as you will recall from his CV, is an experienced barrister
 (58 years old), who sits as an international arbitrator often. He has a
 relationship with Lord Mustill, for what that is worth.  He does alot of
 insurance and re-insurance work, though he says that not many political
 risk insurance cases have reached the bar.  He has worked on a leading case
 involving ECGD, and was, interestingly, an expert witness in an OPIC
 coverage case recently.  {We may consider him for just that role, on the
 DIC issue, should we decide to sue in Texas.} He has dealt with many
 projects of this type and magnitude, from a contractual dispute point of
 view, and done quite a bit of work in the electricity sector on
 privatization matters.  He has done a couple of projects (shipping and
 petroleum industry) in India.  He is available for the next couple of
 weeks, booked for most of December, and then frees up again.  I would rank
 him a strong second choice.
 
 I would propose that we issue Gaisman instructions tomorrow or Monday.  If
 you agree, let me know and I will take care of it.
