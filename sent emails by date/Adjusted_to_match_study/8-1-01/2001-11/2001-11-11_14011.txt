 I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training

 David,  we have schedule Ogletree, Deakins and Nash to conduct Harassment
 and Union Avoidance training at our El Dorado, AK job site on December 4th
 and 5th.  We will be scheduling the training at our Lakeworth job site after
 the first of the year. If you have any questions, please contact me at
 x3136.
