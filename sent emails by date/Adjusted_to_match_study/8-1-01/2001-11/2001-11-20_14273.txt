 Hi Ron - 
 
 It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.
 
 The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.
 
 Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 
 
 Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?
 
 If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?
 
 Thanks for any help you can provide. 
 
 Best regards, 
 
 Jim
