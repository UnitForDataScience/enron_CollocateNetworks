Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that!
 
  
     
 Hi Tana,
 
 A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
 received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  
 
 Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
 give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  
 
 Thanks,
 Diane
