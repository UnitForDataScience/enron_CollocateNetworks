Not a good week for the G.    Sorry to be such a bummer.  Anyway, glad that you like Lucinda.  She does good work.  We'll catch up this weekend.
 
  

                      
       Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who
       cleans
       your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we
    didn't
       show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun?
    Do
       you
       have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.
