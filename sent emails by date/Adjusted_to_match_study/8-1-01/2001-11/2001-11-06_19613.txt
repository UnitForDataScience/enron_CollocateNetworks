    Importance: High
 
 
 Attached for your review and comment is a very rough first draft of the prehearing conference statement that we must bring to the hearing on Wednesday afternoon.  It outlines, with some substance, the issues you have indicated we want to bring up, it identifies a few questions and seeks guidance from AReM members.
  
 Please review and get back to me with comments by the close of the day, if possible.  I am running to the airport (which is why this is not in as finished a form as versions normally sent to you) and will be looking for comments in my hotel room this evening.  
  
 Also, do we want to invite WPTF to join with us again, as it did in the comments last Friday on the Wood Ruling?
  
 thanks!
 
 Dan
