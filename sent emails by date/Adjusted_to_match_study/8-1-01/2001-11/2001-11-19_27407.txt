 I have a follow up question on our discussion at the TAC meeting last
 
 week.  As we discussed, an OOMC instruction for hours 0-24 at 50MW would
 
 for example require a unit to be prepared to provide the 50MW, but not
 
 to actually provide the energy.  Another unit specific instruction or
 
 OOME would be required for the unit to actually run at 50MW.
 
 As recent as this morning, we were told that ERCOT would provide us an
 
 OOME instruction when they want us to run after an OOMC instruction.
 
 However, they also said that we were operating outside the protocols due
 
 to John Adams' interpretation that when we receive an OOMC for a certain
 
 time period at a certain level we should be generating.
 
 We need immediate clarification on this issue.
