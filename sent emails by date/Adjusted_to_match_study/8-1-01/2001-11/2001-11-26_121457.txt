
 
 came back from dallas friday - just went to houstons with a friend.  Saturday, worked on the house and ran some errands.  Went out saturday night and drank too much - just hung out yesterday.  Nothing at all exciting!  I am very boring these days!
 
  
     
 just wanted to remind you to start looking for your c-card now!  don't know if you want to scuba or not, but nice to 
 have options.
 
 Hope you had a nice thanksgiving - we need to go for drinks soon!
