  the stroller box is pretty big
 and heavy.  I'm not sure how much luck I would have getting it up to the
 second story of Susan's house, so what I was thinking was that we could
 give her a card which says what we got her and either leave the actual gift
 downstairs at Susan's house during the shower or in the back of my Jeep and
 I could drop it off at Ed & Jennifer's house after the shower.  Also, if we
 go with the card idea, do you think I should still wrap the stroller box?
 
 Let me know what you think.  I'll be at work today until 4:30.  I'm taking
 off tomorrow so if you need to get in touch with me tomorrow, just call me
 at home and leave a message if I'm not there (713-721-7101).
 
 See you Saturday!!!
