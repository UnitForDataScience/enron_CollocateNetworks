 What do you think of this to send out to the admins in 3AC?
 
 In an effort to better control our space planning needs, effective immediately all ETS moves will be coordinated by Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto. This pertains to all moves, including telephone only moves.
 
 Please contact Pam (X36135)  regarding any moves in the Enron Building, and contact Ruthann (x66538) regarding any moves in the 3AC building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to contact the other.
 
 Thank you for your cooperation.
 
 Feel free to make any changes you'd like.
