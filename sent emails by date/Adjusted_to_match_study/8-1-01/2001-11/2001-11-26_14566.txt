 Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies  that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.
 
 
 You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.
