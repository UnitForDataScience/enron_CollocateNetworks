   thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!
 
 If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 
 
 All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.
 
 Thanks for your support!!
