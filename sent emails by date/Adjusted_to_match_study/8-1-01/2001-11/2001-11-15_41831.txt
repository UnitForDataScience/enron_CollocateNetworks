    on
    two counterparties, we need to know exactly which Williams and British
    Energy Power and Energy Trading Limited entities/subsidiaries will be
    involved in the Master Netting Agreements.  Please let me know.  Also,
    going forward, we will need this type of information for any new
    counterparties added to the current list.  Thanks and please call with
    any
    questions.
 
    Best Regards,
    Athena
 
    P.S.  Please send me your telephone number.  Thanks!
