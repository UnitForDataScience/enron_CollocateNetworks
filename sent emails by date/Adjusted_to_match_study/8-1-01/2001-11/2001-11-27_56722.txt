 Thanks for your message. With all the turbulence going on in Enron
 it's difficult for anybody to leave the office for an extended period of time.
 We shall have to abstain this time and hope to join you in the future.

 attend the Advisory Committee meeting.  Please give my apologies to Paul
 and Howard.
