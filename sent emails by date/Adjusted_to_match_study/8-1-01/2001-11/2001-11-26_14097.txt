 I have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me
 
 1.  For A and B employees, will there be bonuses.  It's crossed out on the A script and left in the B script.
 2.  In the C script:
 	Please explain what a 60-day notice w/o severance plan off-set means.
 	When does severance go into effect for C employees?  It's not clear in the script.
 
 Thanks.
