 I would love to talk market conditions with you but I think we are banned from doing any work for the next three months while this co. continues to fucks with my money.... HACKS !!! 
 
 Although not bitter, for years I have heard the story about being paid fair value for a job well done.. and that my time was coming...( just around the corner).... !! little did I know that when I made that turn, some guy named Jerome.( take a minute to imagine) ...was standing there with a baseball bat looking to smack my head a few times just to make sure I knew I wasn't quite there yet.
 
 HACKS !!!

 You have two cows.
 You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
 credit
 opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
 swap
 with
 an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a
 tax
 exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
 transferred
 via an
 intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
 shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
 company.
 The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
 one
 more.
