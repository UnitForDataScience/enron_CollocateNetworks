 Best,

 For those of you who have gone DA, did all of your ESPs send your names 
 to the utilities by Oct. 5?  Here is the utility filing on DA suspension implementation and that is an important date.  I want to be sure that we don't have any problems along those lines.
 
 I am including copies of the utility filings for those of you who want to learn more about this and why the date is important.  We need to file comments on the utility filings by Nov. 28. Barbara
