I believe that is the right way to go (no terminations Thanksgiving week), so I'd like to go ahead and say it.  Michelle
 
  
     
 
 	
 
 	This week, each business unit has been asked to identify the optimal structure and resources for EIM on a going forward basis..  
 	 While the review is not complete, we are close to finalizing decisions surrounding the business and the employees associated with them.  
 	
 	Until the final decisions have been made, I ask for your continued patience. You will be notified at the appropriate time regarding the future 
 	of the team.  
 
 	Please take the opportunity to enjoy the time with your family next week at Thanksgiving and know that we are 
 	working hard on finalizing all details.
