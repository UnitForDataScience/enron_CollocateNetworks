 I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes 
     
 I booked the Santa lunch and have you guys down for 3.  Sat. Dec. 1 at 11:30 am.  No cancellations after Nov. 23, so just let me know before then if the other event presents a conflict.  Dress Cameron in his Christmas finery for his photo with Santa!
