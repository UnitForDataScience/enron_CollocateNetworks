    I hope the madness that's been occurring over there isn't weighing you
    down
    too much.
 
    I just wanted you to know my offer stands if you'd be interested in
    looking
    at moving to LA to manage our T&E.  Our asset base has been growing and
    we
    are looking to expand some more. Your expertise would be tremendous.
    Let me
    know.
