 	I am the one that was on the phone with the original call on the deal last Friday night and
 	in contact with them up until this past Sunday. Let me know what I can do to help on this
 	deal.

 Chris:
 We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?
