 Hi Deborah!  I understand you got engaged recently and I hope you'll
 accept my congratulations....
 I'm coming to wash dc tomorrow thru wed eve and would love to catch
 up...if you have any time give me a ring...i'm staying at the st.regis
 hotel tomorrow eve, or call me on my cell at 713 854 4952.  I'm meeting
 with a few senators, and cabinet members so i may be out of touch
 temporarily.
 I hope you've been well....
