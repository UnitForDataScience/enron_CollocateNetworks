 Dear Stakeholders:
 
 	At last Tuesday's meeting in Chicago, National Grid promised to circulate a draft proposal for the stakeholder advisory process of the Alliance.  The attached document is a draft.  Because of the extraordinary circumstances of this week, Grid was unable to get full corporate review of the document, and may want to  further modify it.  Nevertheless, because of  Grid's desire to fulfill its promise, it is circulating the current version of the document for stakeholders to begin thinking about.
    
 Best Regards,
