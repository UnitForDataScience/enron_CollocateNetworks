       I've not kept up with Brian for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that Brian worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  Brian really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by Brian and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that Brian and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). 
       As for enemies at Enron

    
 Brian called me last week and shared that you had suggested he call.  As you
 know, he has some significant holes in his resume' and has a few enemies
 within the Enron family.  I never worked with him so I don't know his
 genuine abilities.  Could you shed some light on your experience with Mr.
 Barrington.
 Thanks,
