 Richard & Lisa:  I understand from Carl that there is a call with some of the generators tomorrow to discuss the foregoing.  In that respect, I am forwarding a brief memo that we prepared a number of months ago (prior to PG&E's filing) regarding some of the issues/considerations that potentially would arise if Enron Wind were to file an involuntary petition against SCE.  The memo is a bit "dated" but I nonetheless thought it might be helpful to you to some extent in terms of setting forth some of the relevant considerations that arise in the involuntary context.  Please let me know if you would like any follow up on any of this prior to the call.  Thanks  John
