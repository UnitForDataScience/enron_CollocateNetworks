       Mike,
 
       I understand that you will be signing the lease for the repository.
       Attached please find (1) the lease, (2) attachment A to the lease,
    and
       (3)
       an outstanding invoice.
 
       Please note, I spoke with Tracy Wilson today at the Capitol Mall
       Executive
       Center.  She is expecting early next week the signed lease as well as
       the
       rent payment reflected in the invoice.
 
       Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
       Peter Meringolo
