 Kate:
 
 Per your request I have double checked Risk's daily record on ISO revenue/expenses for WHOURLY book in August and everything checked out.  Here is the result:
 
 Daily ISO revenue/expenses total (8/1-8/31)	+$629,709 (you can also get this number by adding up the ISO report Risk 							distributed to you every morning along with your P&L )
 July ISO true up					+$86,743 
 =>					total	+$716,452
 Month-end August ISO revenue/expenses 	+$716,481 (we got this total from Volume Mgmt)
 Variance (i.e. true-up)				+$29
 
 I have communicated this with Volume Management with the above results.  Jim advised that they might have added some items "after fact" during August but those changes were neither included in the daily ISO flash Risk got nor included in the month-end flash, and that's probably why you are expecting more than what Risk gave you.  Jim and Darren will be looking into their records in order to check out with you.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Fran
