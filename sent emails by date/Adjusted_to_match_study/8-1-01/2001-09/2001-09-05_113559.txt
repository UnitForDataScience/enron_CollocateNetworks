 Steve,  
 
 The NUI/EES Letter of Agreement for the "SDS" storage service has been signed by both Enron and NUI.  September gas is scheduled for delivery to NUI.  This service will ensure that certain customer types will receive firm gas all winter.  Kenneth Maloney, of Cullen and Dykman, was helpful and responded quickly to my submitted draft comments, as well as returning a signed copy via fax.  
 
 Your opinions, suggestions, and direct involvement with NUI on my behalf have proven invaluable in the resolution of this matter.  I want to thank you (perhaps personally on your next Houston trip) for your efforts.  I also want to share this email with others here on the gas desk that may have been unaware of your participation.
 Again, many thanks.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Paul Tate
