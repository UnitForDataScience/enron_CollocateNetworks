 FYI, Enron signed the following customers after July 1 (we are checking on Wal-Mart).
 
 I would like Bev and Hedy to rank these parties with their ability to help in Sacramento with our messaging.  Once you have this, let's talk this afternoon to plan going forward.
 
 As you can see from the e-mail, we are going to have to work through our business people.

 Please note that the originators I have spoken do not want their customer's to be contacted without being consulted.
 
 Hope this helps.  If I hear of any other customers who have signed or renewed after July 1 I will notify you.
