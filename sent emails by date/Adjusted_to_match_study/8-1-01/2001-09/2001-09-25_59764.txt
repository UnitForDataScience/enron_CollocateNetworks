West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?

 All of a sudden (and without prompting - before you ask) I am hearing a lot of noise surrounding Jay Williams and Darren Vanek (?) including a couple of transactions (small but big customers - like International Paper) where the customer is getting very upset as we have refused to do one month deals with them.  Also USX felt the same and we are persuing deals with them too.  Can you look into this for me?  It may be OK but it might be a little over zealous.
 
 
 Noise from East Gas and Lagrasta's groups
 
 Thanks
