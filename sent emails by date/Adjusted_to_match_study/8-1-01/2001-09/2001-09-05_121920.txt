 I understand that there has been a request to run two units at this location beginning Thursday.  Is this a long term commitment?  I've been told that the units will need some work at some point if we expect them to operate on a daily basis.  
 
 



 
  
 Mike Flynn - Canadian Team:  These units are candidates for abandonment.  What day were each of these units last run?  If they have been idle for over one year we can abandon the units under automatic blanket authority.  If we run them, however, it postpones the abandonment-under-automatic-blanket-authority option by another year.  Please let me know ASAP.  Steve
