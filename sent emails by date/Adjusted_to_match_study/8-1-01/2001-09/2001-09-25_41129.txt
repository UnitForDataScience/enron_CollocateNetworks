 Hello Marie, per our conversation this morning, please find attached Coastal
 States Trading, Inc.'s standard schedules, along with a copy of our guaranty
 format.  We prefer to make proposed changes directly on the electronic
 version(as opposed to hard copy).  Please red-line the schedule on the PC,
 put a draft date in the upper right hand corner of the first page of both
 schedules, then email the schedules back to John Shuttee for review.  John
 will handle all negotiations for this ISDA.  He can be reached at

 
 Thanks for attention to this matter.
