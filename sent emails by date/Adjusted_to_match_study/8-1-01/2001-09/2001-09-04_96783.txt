 I have utilized the structuring spreadsheets Tanya used in the original calculations to determine the PG&E receivables.  To the best of my knowledge the following are the settlement numbers for PG&E:
 
 Enron Canada Corp.
 April 1-5	C$2,195,876.67
 		US$387,627.50
 April 6-11	C$2,635,052.00
 		US$465,153.00
 March receivables unchanged.
 
 Enron North America Corp.
 No physical flow in April.  All receivables from March.  No change.
 
 Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
 April 1-5	US$374,720.00
 April 6-10	US$374,720.00
 March receivables unchanged.
 
 Please call if you have any questions.
 Bill

 Liz,
 
 Here is the administrative claim order.  Paragraph 2 provides that "This Order applies only to administrative expense claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 503(a) arising from the sale of electric energy or services for PG&E's customers through the California Independent System Operator (the "ISO") or from the sale of electric energy or services by the California Department of Water Resources (the "DWR") (collectively , "ISO/DWR Administrative Claims").  For purposes of this Order, ISO/DWR Administrative Claims shall not include the following: (i) claims arising from "reliabil,ity must run" ("RMR") charges, (ii) claims by the ISO, and (iii) claims by the DWR based solely on power purchased for direct sale to customers of PG&E, and for which the DWR asserts no independent claim against PG&E or PG&E's bankruptcy estate."
 
 I understand that EPMI sold power to PG&E between April 6, the filing date, and April 9, the date on which EPMI terminated the contract.  Are these considered sales through the ISO?  If they are, we will need to file a separate administrative proof of claim for them by September 20.  If they are not sales through the ISO, the deadline does not apply.
