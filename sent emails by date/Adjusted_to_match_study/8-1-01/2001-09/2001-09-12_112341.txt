 Dan has informed me that Enron's share of remaining costs in the Enron v. FERC matter will not exceed $4,000, for the work done to prepare for oral argument scheduled for November 7, 2001.
 
 If you need a more formal document indicating this, I would be happy to send one to you.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
