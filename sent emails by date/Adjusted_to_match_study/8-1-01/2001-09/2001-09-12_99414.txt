   involved in this matter.  You along with a spouse/significant other are invited.  How does Tuesday, October 2 look?  I would like to do it sooner, but Mr. Manne has informed me that, due to his busy social calendar, he is not available before then.  We will plan on beginning at around 7 p.m. Please let me know if you can attend.
