 Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response

   Attached are the draft comments.  I apologize for the delay.  We were distracted by the FERC meeting - exciting day.  You all must be happy about the Commission's discussions on RTOs but uncertain about the market power initiatives.
 
    Please call Sam or me with any comments on the filing.  
 
 Thank you, 
 
 Cathy
