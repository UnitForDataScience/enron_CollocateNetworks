 Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.
 
 On the plus side:
 He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills.
 He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the "MOU" for Edison that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU.
 His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political "center of gravity"a demand that most believe originated with Edison.
 3)	Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.
 
 Hope this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.  
 
 Best,
 Jeff
