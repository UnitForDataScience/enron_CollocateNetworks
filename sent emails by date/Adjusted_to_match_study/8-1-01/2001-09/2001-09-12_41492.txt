 Marie,
 
   I just got a call from Dirk at Universal Access.  He was laid off - I thought he was a nice guy and a good lawyer.  Let me know if you hear about any openings.  Maybe we can make it to the decorative center next week.  If you want to go earlier, the number for Kravet is 4079171-B.  I will probably need to do Robert Allen in person since it is new.  Thanks
