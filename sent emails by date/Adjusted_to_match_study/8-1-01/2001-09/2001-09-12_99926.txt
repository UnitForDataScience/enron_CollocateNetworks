  We are  moved by the alarming news and crisis that our country
  is facing.   This, the greatest nation, founded in the belief of "In
  God We Trust"  and the "Land of the Free".
  Please have mercy on  those
  suffering, hurting and in fear, and give wisdom & strength to  those who
  are
  assisting.  May the forces of evil be  broken by your power and may
 we  humble before thee, our strength and  refuge.
  Give wisdom to all our President & our  leaders
  and bring your  comforting peace
  through the  power of your Holy Spirit.  Help us here to reach out
  to those  that have been affected by this tragedy.
   In the name of our Lord  and Savior, Christ Jesus.  AMEN
 
   Please send this to all your  friends and create a prayer chain
   throughout  this  nation.
