  that's who we are, THE people and we will not =
 be  defeated. With that, the passengers  on the plane all began to applaud,=
  people had tears in their eyes, and we began  the trip toward the runway. =
 The  flight attendant then began the safety speech. One of the things she s=
 aid is  that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace. She=
  asked that  everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce =
 themselves, tell  each other something about your families and children, sh=
 ow pictures, whatever.  She said "for today, we consider you family. We wil=
 l treat you as such and ask  that you do the same with us." Throughout the =
 flight we learned that for the crew, this was their first  flight since Tue=
 sday's tragedies. It was a day that everyone leaned on each  other and toge=
 ther everyone was stronger than any one person alone. It was quite  an expe=
 rience. You can imagine the  feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles=
  and we heard "welcome to  Washington Dulles Airport, where the local time =
 is 5:40". Again, the cabin was  filled with applause. It has been a  very l=
 ong day and one that I am glad is over. I have been constantly reminded  th=
 is day of the ar! ticle in JAAMT that Barbara Williams recently wrote where=
   she referenced the tornados in Oklahoma and said something like, "Do we g=
 et mad  and shake our fists at God in anger? No, we go on and conquer our f=
 ears and  continue our lives." It is my hope that is what we do now. Last n=
 ight I saw a  program with college students where one of them said that at =
 their campus there  are no more hyphenated titles, i.e., African-American, =
 etc., everyone is just an  American. No one will ever be able to take that =
 pride away from  us.=20
