    Hello Andy,
 
    I refer to your email of 20th September, 2001 seeking clarification in
 
    respect of the advice we gave you on the 19th of September, 2001 on the
 
    Fuel Management Agreement (Agreement).
 
    You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc (Enron/Fuel
 
    Manager) could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any
 
    potential theories such as agency relationship, third party beneficiary
 
    claims etc.
 
    MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement.  These
 
    include amongst others, approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed
 
    by the Fuel Manager, providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices
 
    issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA, etc.
 
    There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered
 
    into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and
 
    no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf.
 
    Enron's right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement, is
 
    contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee
 
    by MSEB.  I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB.
 
    The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by
 
    the provisions of the PPA, to which Enron is not a party.  Therefore
 
    there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEB/DPC as regards
 
    the PPA.  As a result, Enron has no claim against MSEB for non-payment
 
    of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against
 
    MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions
 
    under the Agreement.
 
    I trust I have answered your query adequately.  Please feel free to call
 
    for any questions that you may have.
 
    Kind regards,
 
    Suresh
