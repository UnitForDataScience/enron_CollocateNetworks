 Steve here is my thoughts on the comercial language that should be in the contract
 
 Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin in load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  Enron will engage its best efforts to provide the strongest bids and offers on an hourly basis.  The timing of when Enron is informed of the PUD's positions will have a large affect on the prices received.  Enron would appreciate all trades to be communicated at or before 15 minutes past the hour for the following trading hour.  In addition, Enron can only trade integer power volumes due to the wholesale power practices.  As a result, the minimum power quantity must be at least 1 MW.  Enron prefers power volumes to be at least 5 MW.
