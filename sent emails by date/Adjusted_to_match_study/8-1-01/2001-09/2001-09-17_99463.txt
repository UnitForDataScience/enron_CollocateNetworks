    RESENT AS OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.  I WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH THE
    CALL ON
    A BRIEF BASIS TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY INTEREST IN A MEETING WITH SCE OR A
    CONFERENCE CALL WITH SCE's COUNSEL. THE CONFERENCE CALL SHOULD LAST LESS
    THAN 30 MINUTES.  IF NEED BE, WE CAN RECONVENE LATER TODAY.
 
 
    We have set a call to discuss SCE for this Monday.  The agenda will be
    similar to the agenda of the 12th, except that the California
    Legislature is
    set to adjourn this Friday evening, so we should know what ensured.  As
    it
    has been our intent to be as inclusive as possible, if there are other
    creditors that you wish to invite, please do so.
