Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  
 
 I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  
 
 Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.
 
 The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.

 Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!
 Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and
 drink all that beer.
 
 The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been
 spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right
 now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game
 this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you
 never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet?
