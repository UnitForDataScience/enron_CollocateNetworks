 Absolutely,
 Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month. Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need (I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs).  Let's put this in effect by October. I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges (and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290with them paying the extra per month.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
