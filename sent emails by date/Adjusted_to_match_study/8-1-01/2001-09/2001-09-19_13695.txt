 David,
 
 
 
 I have been advised by our Construction Manager, Mr. Joe Osler that while he
 was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept
 regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired
 about permit requirements to picket our site.  Apparently the City informed
 them that no permit is required.  I have heard that the pipefitters have
 established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today. We will need local
 legal counsel to assist us in this regard.
 
 
 
 Mike Indivero, I understand that Mr. Mike Croall's release date from NEPCO
 is Oct 31, 2001.  Please advise as to who his replacement is and their
 report date.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
