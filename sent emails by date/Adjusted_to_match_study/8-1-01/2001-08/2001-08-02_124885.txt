 After yesterdays cuts there have been some changes in the Colstrip Cut Procedures.
 
   specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit Stone, etc.
 	(these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.)
 

 
 6.) Finally link the deals.
 
 7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.
 
 8.) Make cuts in Lotus Notes Cuts Database (this is the most time consuming portion of this procedure).
 
 9.) Make notes in Discussion Forum
 
 10.) Email appropriate groups, Kate Symes, and myself.
 
 If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.
 Thanks,
 Bill
