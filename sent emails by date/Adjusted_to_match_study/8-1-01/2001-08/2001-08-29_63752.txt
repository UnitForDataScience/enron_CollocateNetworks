 Ken and Linda Lay would very much like to attend the dinner on September 12.  Will you please send me the details or phone me at 713-853-6773?
 
 Thanks.

  I called this morning to ask you to dinner with John Martel after the  book 
 signing on Sept.12.  It will be very casual.  I do hope you  can make it.  Let 
 me know as soon as possible.   Lee and Joe  Jamail
