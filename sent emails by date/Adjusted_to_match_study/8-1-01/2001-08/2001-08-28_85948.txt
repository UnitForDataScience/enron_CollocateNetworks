 Steve,
 
 I was hoping you could help me with the following two issues.  I am not sure who in legal is working on these.  
 
 1) Crawfish Right-of-Ways (counterparty:  Bridgeline) - Bridgeline is requesting ROWs/easements on the Crawfish land in LA.  Keith Daigle, I suppose, is the one who would be actually drafting the agreements.  Roger Westbrook recently received the plats and general descriptions which are to be attached to the agreements.  Would you know the status on these documents?    
 
 2) Napoleonville (counterparty: Texas Brine) - Texas Brine purchase approximately 16.6 acres from Enron at the Napoleonville Salt Dome earlier this year.  Texas Brine is attempting to clear title for this land.  The executed documents from the sale of the land from Enron Storage Co to Bridgeline Storage Co and then from Bridgeline Storage Co to LRCI.  were apparently never filed at the courthouse.  Texas Brine is very eager to get this cleared up.  Do you know whether Legal has these documents?    
 
 Thanks for your help,
