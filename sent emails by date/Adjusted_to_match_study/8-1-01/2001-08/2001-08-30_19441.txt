 Essentially the draft updates his alternate from June.  It does not suspend
 direct access but opens a proceeding addressing issues surrounding the
 suspension. The alternate contains some good language slamming DWR and its
 potentially high price contracts.
 
 I do not have an electronic version of the  alternate.  Let me know if you
 want a faxed copy.
