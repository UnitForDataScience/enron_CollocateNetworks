 Infield
   what that
 means is we receive back both the rodeo performance and chuckwagon race
 performance to be sold as a package.
 
 This "return" of suite dates does not traditionally occur until the new
 year, when the companies begin to firm up their plans for the upcoming
 Stampede.  Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to
 lease suites for a single day or days.
 
 To be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all
 company details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.
 
 Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to
 assist.
