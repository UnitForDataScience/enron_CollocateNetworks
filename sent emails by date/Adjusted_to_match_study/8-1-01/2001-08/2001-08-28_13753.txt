 I'm sending for you the model of AMENDMENT TO THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.
 
 It was adapted according Brazil labor law requirements and it was revised by Veirano & Associados Advogados (Legal Counselor).
 
 I believe that Corporate can analyse this model. If they agree with me, we will be implementing in future cases.
 
 Nowadays we continue to use the Enron purpose form, although it contains clauses against our Brazilian
 labor law.
 
 If you have any doubts, call me.
 
 Regards.
