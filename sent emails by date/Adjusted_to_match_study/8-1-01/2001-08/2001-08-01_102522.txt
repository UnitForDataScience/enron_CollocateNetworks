    Susan,
 Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to
 do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday. I will ask though.
 You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and
 leaving Korea on Sunday). The total air fare should be $962. Shoot me
 a quick e mail if this is not ok. Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing
 your tickets this afternoon. Thanks!
