With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.

 Paul,
 
 As promised last week, please find attached to this correspondence a
 draft term sheet which outlines six potential asset management
 outsourcing arrangements.  These various proposal structures signify
 initial steps representing general commercial concepts to be further
 refined by a transaction team.
 
 I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in
 the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal
 department.  
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Regards, 
 
 Jean
