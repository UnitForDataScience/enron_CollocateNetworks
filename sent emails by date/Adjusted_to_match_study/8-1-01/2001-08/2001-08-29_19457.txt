 Dan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m=
 emory
 
 
 
 (Published Aug. 29, 2001)=20
 
 Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in =
 decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics=
 .=20
 
 The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray D=
 avis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining=
  its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is =
 odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll=
 ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20
 
 Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated=
  around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea=
 ched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util=
 ity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft=
 er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo=
 th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l=
 ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta=
 il rates.=20

 The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on=20
 amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed,=20
 some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee=20
 members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by=20
 TURN and other consumer groups.=20
 
 During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and=
 =20
 Richard Katz from the Governor=19 s office regarding a couple of issues=20
 highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more=
 =20
 technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently,=
 =20
 Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff=19 s request.  D.J. agreed that the =
 bill=20
 needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA=20
 contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard abou=
 t=20
 it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying=
 =20
 amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to=20
 believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too=20
 self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct=20
 access.  We suggested that =1C shall=1D be changed to =1C may=1D in order t=
 o give more=20
 leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn=19 t necessarily op=
 pose=20
 the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can=20
 totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).=20
 
 A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to=20
 push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this=20
 bill passes.=20
 
 There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor=19 s=
 =20
 desk.=20
 
 The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote o=
 n=20
 additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.=20
