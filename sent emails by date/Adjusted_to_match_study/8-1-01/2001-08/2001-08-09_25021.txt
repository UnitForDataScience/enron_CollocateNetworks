 I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work. A little old for my taste as well. She is hot though. She looks exactly like Mariah Carey. It is great hanging out with her. It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties. Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town.
