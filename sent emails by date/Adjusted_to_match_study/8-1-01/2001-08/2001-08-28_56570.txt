 Thanks for your message. I stay in touch with many academic centers and
 shall be glad to bring up to your attention other potential candidates. 
 I often hear about academics who contemplate moving to this
 part of the country.

 The finance faculty and I have reviewed the vita of Richard McMinn.  He
 appears to be a very good person but we are attempting to find someone who
 is already or has the potential to be a major star to fill the Enron
 Chair.  McMinn is not at that level in our judgment even though I am sure
 that he would be a good person to have on a faculty.  At our stage of
 growth and development, we need to fill tenured positions with extreme care
 and with individuals who are or have star potential.
 
 Thanks for bringing him to our attention.
