 Per -
 
 I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher. Could you please ask Shanna to take this situation to Sharon tomorrow?
 
 John, Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions. I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur. 
 
 Thank you
