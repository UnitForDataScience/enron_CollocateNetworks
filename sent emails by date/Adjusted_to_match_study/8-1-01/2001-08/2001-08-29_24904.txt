 Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior lights. Chicks are going to love it. I'm going to get a chick with a python wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 6 inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims. SWEET! The funny thing is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that would be a killer ride.
