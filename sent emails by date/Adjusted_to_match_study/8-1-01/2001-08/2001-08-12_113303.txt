 According to the Draft Order that was voted out at the Commission meeting t=
 oday, the subject project, as amended to reflect the approval of the Califo=
 rnia Action Project, is approved, subject to certain conditions including r=
 estrictions on rolled-in rate treatment. =20
 
 The Commission was concerned that the additional fuel costs could exceed th=
 e rate reduction to existing shippers.  Kern River's projections were based=
  on a $3.00/dth cost of gas.  The Commission conditioned its approval of ro=
 lled-in rate treatment by providing that, "in its future compliance tariff =
 filing to roll-in the costs and lower transmission rates, Kern River must s=
 ubmit revised exhibits showing the excess revenues over the incremental cos=
 t-of-service, and the net benefits after anticipated fuel costs are conside=
 red" (Kern River's settlement in RP99-274 requires it to reduce its rates f=
 or existing customers coincident with the in-service date for newly certifi=
 cated facilities if it receives approval for rolled-in rate treatment).  Ad=
 ditionally, if during any year, the combined level of the electric and gas =
 fuel expenses exceed the benchmark level(s) of excess revenues established =
 in the tariff filing, then Kern River must allocate the excess portion of f=
 uel costs to its expansion shippers.  Thus, Kern River must always assure t=
 hat this expansion does not increase costs for existing shippers.
 
 The Commission rejected concerns of the existing firm shippers as well as S=
 oCal Gas about the potential for additional curtailment at Wheeler Ridge.  =
 The Commission found that the potential for increased curtailment did not w=
 arrant rejection or modification of Kern River's proposal, in part because =
 SoCal Gas does not offer firm service on its system and therefore existing =
 shippers have never had any assurance that Socal Gas would accept their gas=
 . =20
