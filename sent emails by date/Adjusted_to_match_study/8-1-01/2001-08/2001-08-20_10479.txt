 	look at the possibility of Robert being at the customer meeting.  I appreciate your comments.
 	I am glad Shawn is going to be able to attend.  Have a good week.  Thanks. Lynn

 I am planning to attend the NNG Winter Ops Meeting the second week of
 September as we discussed.  However, my NNG rep Robert Benningfield informs
 me that he and other reps might not be allowed to attend.  This was the
 same case as last year.  Since I interact with my reps on a daily basis,
 they are the ones familiar with our business and our operational concerns.
 I think that it would be beneficial to us for him and other reps to attend
 as they would be able to provide insight to the proceedings as they pertain
 to our business.  We are investing time and money to attend these meetings
 each year.  I think we should make sure that we get the most return out of
 them.  Let me know if you can contact your counterpart at NNG to voice our
 interest?
 
 Thanks.
 
 Shawn
