 SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) Senator Soto offered extensive amendments to the bill
 immediately prior to today's hearing.  Because the staff did not have time
 to review the amendments the bill was held over until Thursday.  Some of the
 amendments remove municipal utilities, self cogeneration and QFs from the
 provisions of the bill.
