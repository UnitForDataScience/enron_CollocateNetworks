
 
 The second draft is correct.  Section 4.7 should be in the agreement. Sorry for the confusion.
 
  

    
 
 I am confused!  The first document did NOT have 4.7.  The second
 e-mail HAS 4.7 included.  Is it supposed to be in or out?
 
 Thanks
 
 Janie K.

 
  
 
 
  I inadvertently sent a draft a draft with Section 4.7.  Please see the
 attached and disregard the previous.
