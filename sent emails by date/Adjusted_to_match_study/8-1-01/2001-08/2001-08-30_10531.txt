 Dear Amber, Alfredo and Fabio,
 many thanks for the opportunity of visiting Enron in Houston.
 Your colleagues provided me with a great lot of information and advice.
 Rebecca Cantrell and Lynn Blair were very kind and helpful, in sparing their time with me and in organizing other meetings with colleagues.
 They are very fine and I appreciate.
 Maybe we would discuss, should the occasion come, some of the aspects of open access in the USA and their appropriateness for the italian case.
 Best Regards
 Mauro Formaggio
