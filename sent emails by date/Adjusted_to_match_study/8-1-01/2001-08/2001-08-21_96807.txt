 de's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the mod=
 ern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were =
 starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But=
  in the meanwhile a preview.
 
 The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin=
 g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve=
 ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe=
 rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall=
 enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will=
  be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After=
  hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne=
 w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me=
 et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi=
 ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide=
 nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be=
  able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p=
 ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  =
 He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell h=
 im line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is =
 something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others c=
 an begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet an=
 other name for himself.=20
