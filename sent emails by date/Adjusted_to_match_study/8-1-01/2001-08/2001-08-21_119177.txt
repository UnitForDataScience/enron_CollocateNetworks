 METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds
 of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet
 will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method
 # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
 do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same
 day service on all orders.
 This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and
 address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
 receive the report.
 
 Notes:
 1) Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY only) for each Report.
 Checks NOT accepted.
 
 2) Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets
 of paper.
 
 3) On one of those sheets of paper, Write:
 
 1. the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering,
 
 2. YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and
 
 3. your name and postal address. (In case of e-mail difficulties. )
