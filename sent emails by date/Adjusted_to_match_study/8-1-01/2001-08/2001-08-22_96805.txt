    Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some
    of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss
    the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale
    commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on
    Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m.
    (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John
    LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a
    very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The
    other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES
    and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to
    proceed.  Thanks.  John
