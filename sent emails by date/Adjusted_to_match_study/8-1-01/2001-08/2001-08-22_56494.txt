 As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!
