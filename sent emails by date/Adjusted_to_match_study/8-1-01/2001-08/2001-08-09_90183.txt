 Guys -
 
 I am not comfortable leaving the appropriations risk "grey", as it has been referred to.  The risk is there and it is real.  If the EES Executive Comittee is comfortable with this strategy/approach then I would expect to have something in writing between EES and EWS releasing EWS of any and all $$ reponsibility associated with this potential, yet unmentioned, risk.
 
 FYI, last time we priced this risk we came up with a notional value of $5MM.
 
 I am on board with providing aggressive pricing and trying to enter new markets.  However, we need to recognize all the risks.
