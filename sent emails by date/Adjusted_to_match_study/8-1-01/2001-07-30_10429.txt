 The customer accounts status meeting was held today, July 26th.  Marketing had one follow up item related to Terra and what the status of the receivable and related settlement is.  I am following up with Frank and will get back with Shelly's group. 
 
 You should be receiving copies of the package shortly.
 
 Please let know if you have any questions.
 
 Dana
