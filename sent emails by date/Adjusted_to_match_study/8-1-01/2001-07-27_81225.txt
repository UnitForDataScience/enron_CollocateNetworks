 Greg asked me to get a price for Lindsay Park first thing in the morning.  Given their load profile we would be offered at 4.39/gj for supply one year out of August.  Please let me know if you need any thing else.
  
 Best Regards,
  
 Jon
 
     
 
 Jon,
  
 Lindsay Park is being a pain in the butt - could you update me on price.  I know we are up today - when do you think prices may get back down to 4.25 range again?
  
 Start Date - August 1 
  
 Thanks
