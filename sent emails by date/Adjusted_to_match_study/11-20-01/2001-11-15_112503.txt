   I spoke with Craig Shields (who replaced Beth Goodman on license application preparation) and he was aware of a "letter" that was sent to the VA commission requesting that our gas pilot license be converted to a permanent gas supply license.  He said "someone here reviewed it" and that it was "very short."  I have asked for a copy of what was sent.  I'll keep you posted... MLC
