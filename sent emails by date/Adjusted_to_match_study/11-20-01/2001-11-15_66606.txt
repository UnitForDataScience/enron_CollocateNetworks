    Thanks for helping us understand the tranportation and storage problem
    today. We appreciate your patience. I know it's like teaching a baby how
    to
    walk!
 
    Anyway, just wanted to get you the updated numbers for the
    transportation
    scenario, based on the changes you made at teh meeting today.  Can you
    also
    double check with Philip regarding the issue with hedging Basis with
    regards to transportation?
 
    Have a great weekend!
 
    Thanks!
