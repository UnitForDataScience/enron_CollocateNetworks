 Group,
 We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below.
 
 So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.
 
 1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE dealsfor example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.
 
 6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.
 
 Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Bill
