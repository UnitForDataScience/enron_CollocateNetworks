Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -

 You have two cows.
 You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
 credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a
 debt/equity
 swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back,
 with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
 transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned
 by
 the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to
 your
 listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
 an
 option on one more.
