 You should know that we are unhappy about something else now.  For the
 11/14 gas day you (NNG) did not let us reduce our FDD withdrawal
 nomination to zero in the 8 am process like normal because of a storage
 injection allocation.  Because of this WP&L is going to get hit with SUL
 DDVC penalties. Entergy-Koch who handles the IES assests was surprised
 by this as well and IES may incur penalties too.
 
 We weren't trying to make an injection, we were just trying to cut our
 withdrawal to zero.  We always schedule a maximum withdrawal in the
 winter because we are always at risk of a zone allocaton just like we
 have been seeing lately.  We've had conference call with Jean Blair and
 Jerry Wilkens on the topic.  We are also in trouble now for the 11/15
 gas day, which we are current trying to figure a way out of.  You can
 add this item to our discussion topics when you visit.

 Lynn, as indicated in my voice mail, Frank and I would like you to call
 Jeff Hicken of Alliant Energy.  He would like someone to explain, (1)
 why he is getting allocated at the zone level when he is trying to
 adjust his timely cycle noms later in the day to reflect lower
 requirements, and (2) what are his alternatives, especially as storage
 may have a chance of being allocated.  Please call Jeff today.  He can
 be reached at 608-252-3173.
 
 Thank you.
