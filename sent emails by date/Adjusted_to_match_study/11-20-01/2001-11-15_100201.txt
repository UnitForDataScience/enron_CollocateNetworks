Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha

 Greg:
 
 A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
 	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
 	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
 	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?
 
 Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!
 
 	Thanks, Jim
