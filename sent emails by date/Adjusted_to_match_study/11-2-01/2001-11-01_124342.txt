 Enron Venture Capitalism
 You have two cows.
 You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
 credit
 opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
 with
 an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
 exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
 via an
 intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
 shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
 company.
 The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
 more.
