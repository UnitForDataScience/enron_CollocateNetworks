 Will you either assign to take care of this?  I'm not sure what they need exactly.
 
 Thanks!

 AIG, a hedge fund that we deal with, has done 2 weather trades: an original trade on 10/29/01 (W1597) and an offsetting one yesterday. 
 
 Both trades need to be rebooked to reflect the fact that AIG allocates all its trades between 2 entities: AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund Ltd and AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP. The split between the 2 counterparties is: 77% to Ltd and 23% to LP. 
 
 At the moment, the original trade as well as (I'm assuming) the offsetting one are booked only to LP. Please rebook the trades, changing both the tick size and the cap amount, to reflect the above allocations. By my calculation, they should be as follows:
 
 Entity				Tick Size			Cap
 AIG Commodity Arb. Fund. Ltd	$1540				$308,000
 AIG Commodity	Arb. Fund  LP	$460				$92,000
 
 Once the deals are rebooked, please also reconfirm them this way. The confirmations will need to include a complete deemed ISDA (you can contact Diane Anderson if you need a copy of the specific deemed ISDA we use for DKR). 
 
 Thanks a lot for this.
