 I would appreciate if you could tell me what is going to happen with my L1-Visa (and the L2 of my wife), if the worst case scenarios for Enron become true.
 In particular:
 Could Enron transfer my Visa to other US company?
 How long could I stay in the US if Enron terminates my contract?
 Could we stay in the country if my wife gets a legal job as a teacher?
 Do I have any other alternative?
 
 Thank you very much.
