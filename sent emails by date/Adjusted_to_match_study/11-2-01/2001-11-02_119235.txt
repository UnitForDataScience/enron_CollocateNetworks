 This has been a challenge for us in other deals - in a recent transaction
 that Mary and I worked on, we had to limit the types of legal services to
 be provided to ministerial/information gathering for fear of losing
 privilege.  I need to think about this and talk to a couple people to see
 if we can come up with a workable solution, so I'll get back to you on
 this.

 Any thoughts on how we provide legal support for Swapco?  Should that be
 covered by the Services Agreement?  Can lawyers who work for ENA
 represent Swapco without a conflict?
