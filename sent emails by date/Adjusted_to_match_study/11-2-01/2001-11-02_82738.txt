 I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.
 
 Hugs
 
  

             
 
    Hey Tricey!
 
    I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
    going
    on? How are the boys?
 
    Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
    yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.
 
    Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday
    but
    she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
    Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to
    you.
    Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer
    at
    4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
    address I have one for her too?
