I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.  She'll speak with Yair.

    As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
    incorporating
    the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
    (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
    the
    last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
    suggest
    that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
    since it is the final version.
 
     <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>
 
    Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
    which
    point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
    page)
    via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
    Schedule with your revised Schedule.
 
    Thank you for your patience.
 
    Regards,
    Michelle
