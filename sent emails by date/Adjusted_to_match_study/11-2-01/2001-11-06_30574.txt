 PLEASE BE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW WHEN SAVING DATA YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO YOUR APPLICATION PRIOR TO EXITING:
 
 SAVE WILL SAVE THE DATA BACK TO THE DATABASE.  THIS TAKES MORE TIME THAN WHEN YOU OPENED THE APPLICATON BECAUSE YOU ARE SENDING BACK MORE DATA.  YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE" IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER BEFORE EXITING.  THE HOUR GLASS MAY STOP RUNNING, BUT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE", IT IS NOT FINISHED SAVING ALL THE DATA.

  DONE
 
 
 If you have any questions or experience any further lost data, please call me.
 Thanks,
 Pat
