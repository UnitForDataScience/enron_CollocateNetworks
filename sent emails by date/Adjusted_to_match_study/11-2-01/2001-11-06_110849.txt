 Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  
 
 I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.
 
 Let me know ,
 Theresa

 Theresa - here's the latest by month of the imbalance.  Please let me know if
 there is any way that I can help you.  Could I look at current month, while you
 look at the past stuff?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria
