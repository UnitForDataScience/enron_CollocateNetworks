 We are doing our annual review of disaster/recovery procedures and
 expecting to make revisions in light of the Sept. 11 attack.  Our current
 plans are based on the potential of a fire damaging the building or a
 hurricane in the region.  We are interested in knowing what other options
 companies are planning for:  the building being gone?  toxic chemicals in
 the area causing a whole area to be evacuated?  other ideas?
 
 We are also interested in any references on companies that have been a
 resource for helping to decide what to plan for and how to manage the
 risks.
 
 Thanks for your help,
