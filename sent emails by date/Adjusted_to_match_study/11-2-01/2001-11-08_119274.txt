    Deb - do you know if we have obtained EIN numbers for both ERMT LLC and
    ERMT Corp.?  I assume since we got a bank account we have one for Corp.,
    but didn't know about LLC.  I also assume that the Canadian counsel have
    received the proper tax ID or other info for ERMT Canada Corp.  Also,
    fyi,
    we will be changing the names of the US entities today to "NETCO
    Holdings
    LLC" and "The New Energy Trading Company".  I will check with Mark
    Taylor
    on the Canadian name change.  Thanks.
