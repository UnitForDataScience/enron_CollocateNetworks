A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Theresa - here's the latest by month of the imbalance.  Please let me know if
 there is any way that I can help you.  Could I look at current month, while you
 look at the past stuff?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria
