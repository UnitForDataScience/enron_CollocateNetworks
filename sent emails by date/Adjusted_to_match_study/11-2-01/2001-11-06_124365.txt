 I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those
 should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you
 see
 any other changes that are necessary.
 
 Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize

 other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by
 December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?
