 Hi guys,
 
 We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.
 
 I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
 He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.
 
 Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?
 
 Many thanks
 
 Andy
